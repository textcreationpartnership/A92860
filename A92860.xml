            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have formerly been <hi>ingaged</hi> in our publick Affairs, but have ſince been ſo long <hi>disingaged,</hi> as may well free me from the ſuſpition of being a Courtier; being both offended at, and an offence to them that be in Power: I am free from all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are in the Nation, and ſhall uſe my Liberty, in dealing as impartially as I can (or as my weakneſs will permit) 'twixt you and our preſent Governors, whom you oppoſe; if I do incline to either ſide, 'tis to you, as moſt needing Pity: 'Tis true, they are to be pitied rather than envied, yet your condition ſeems to me much worſe than theirs every way, as much weaker and darker, in your way and ſpirits, as you are in outward place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

I am a man ſo much under Temptation, Offence, Perſecution and Contempt, that if there be a Party of ſuch, I am very natural to them; and, if there be any by as in my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to incline me to any, it is to ſuch: I aſſure you, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of what I have written, my Judgement ſmites me, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been more gentle to you, than in <hi>Juſtice</hi> and in <hi>true Love</hi> I ought to be, or than your caſe requires I ſhould be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall, I doubt, in tranſcribing of it, be neceſſitated to more ſharpneſs than I intended: But if I were not conſcious to my ſelf of a Deſign of <hi>Love</hi> to you in it, and that in this work I ſhould more ſerve you than them, I could not proceed in it.</p>
            <p>I have examin'd and obſerv'd all things of this nature (that I have met with) againſt this preſent Government, they have paſs'd the private cenſure of my Pen, though not publiſh'd; and this I muſt ſay of yours and the reſt, That though this preſent ſtate of things be very reproveable, having much evil in it; yet none of you have come forth in Righteouſneſs and Judgment againſt it, nor in a Light that is able either to Convince or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct; but a deal of weak and dark Accuſations, from mindes uncaſie and ſick with Paſſion and Diſcontent, all tending to blow up a Spirit of Wrath and Violence, and ſo to multiply our Wounds and Maladies, not to cure them. I have hitherto been ſilent, thinking that thoſe weak Paſſions that have looked out, would vaniſh quickly as ſmoke, and ſo they have: But in this Paper of yours the humors are more groſs, are gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:115669:3"/>and come out in an outward Tumor, as if you intended to make a buſineſs of it; and therefore I am drawn forth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to Treat fairly with you, and to divert you from your courſe, which, I fear, is dangerous to your ſelves and to us all: And this I do upon a double ground;</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, As one that hath an Intereſt in the common Peace of the Nation, and in the Safety of the Honeſt and Religious Party; both which are lodg'd, for the preſent, in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be it never ſo corrupt: This <hi>Open</hi> and <hi>

            <p n="2">II. Secondly, I would deal with you as a Chriſtian, and one that earneſtly deſire to ſee the leaſt: Beam of the true Glory of that Kingdom of Chriſt that you profeſs for: True, you have the Name and Notion of it amongſt you, and that too pitifully beſmear'd with Darkneſs and Folly; but for the thing it ſelf, you are ſo ſhort of it, yea ſo oppoſite to it, that when it ſhall come forth in Truth and Power, you will not be able to ſtand before it; I am very much perſwaded, that if you had any thing

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> and of its <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> you would hide your ſelves in Shame and Self-condemnation, and not appear openly for it: And therefore I cannot, but in that little knowledge that I have of Religion, appear againſt your <hi>

            </p>
            <p>O take no pleaſure in medling with Sin and Evil in any, God knows is a grief to me to deal with it; were it not neceſſary for your Inſtruction, I could not at all take notice of: I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I am not able to do you good, without diſcovering your weakneſs to you and the world; my intention is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn or diſhonor you, but to direct you into a better path: You are now come forth againſt your Brethren in the <hi>common Road</hi> of Accuſation and worldly Enmity, wherein you diſturb the peace of your own houſe, where you may live quietly; you gratifie your Enemies, and that railing, wrathful Spirit that is abroad in the world, and cannot but wound and vex your own ſouls: I ſhall onely wiſh you to retire into your ſelves and your own ſouls; you fight now with the <hi>Fame, Appearance</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shew</hi> of Sin in your Brethren; you may at home deal with the very <hi>Spirit, Body</hi> and <hi>Root</hi> of the ſame Unrighteouſnes, where if you prevail, you may come forth to convince them and ſave us; whereas in that blinde way in which you are, you can do nothing, but wound, provoke, build up Wrath, harden and ſtrengthen Sin amongſt us.</p>
            <p>As it is not my intent to condemn you ſo not to juſtifie them that you condemn; The whole world cryes out againſt them: I have not Love enough to wipe off all that is charg'd upon them, they muſt therefore patiently bear their Reproach, till God bring ſorth their Righteouſneſs; I fear they are guilty, it may be, of more than you can accuſe them of; but certainly, not
<pb facs="tcp:115669:4"/>of all you accuſe them of: <hi>Its a ſmall thing to be judg'd of man;</hi> If they have Innocency at home, 'twill make them think ſo: Man judges by appearance, <hi>God ſearches the heart;</hi> They are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Tryal, and will in time ſhew what is in them: All that I deſire for them is, That they may not be diſturb'd in their Work, which is, To Protect as in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> till God bring forth ſome more excellent <hi>Glory</hi> amongſt us: They are a People that profeſs the <hi>Name of God,</hi> and have appeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

What I offer to you, is the frame of my Spirit concerning publick Tranſactions, and the Obſervations that I have made upon things while I have been a Spectator; Thus far I may commend them to you, That what I adminiſter to you (if you can receive it) will be more profitable and pleaſant to you, than that Spirit in which you act: All that I deſire of you is, but that you would lay aſide <hi>Wrath, malice,</hi> &amp;c. which darken the minde, and that you would with <hi>Meekneſs</hi> admit them to a friendly and ingenuous Conſideration.

                  <p>Foraſmuch as you have cauſed great ſearchings of heart, and Diviſions among many of Gods people, by a ſudden, ſtrange and unexpected Alteration of Government, and other Actions, to the great aſtoniſhment of thoſe who knew your former publick Reſolutions and Declarations; conſidering alſo how (contrary to foregoing Acts and Engagements) you have taken upon you a Power, by which you are utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enabled (and if there were in you a heart) to proſecate the good things covenanted and contended for, with ſo many great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115669:5"/>hazards, and the effuſion of ſo much precious blood; and by reaſon whereof you are become juſtly ſuſpected in your Ends in time paſt, and Actions for future, to very many of thoſe, of whoſe Affections and faithful Services you have injoyed no ſmall ſhare; in all the difficult Paſſages and Enterprizes of the late War: Theſe things conſidered by us (as we know they are by many Churches and Saints) and there being a deep ſence upon our Spirits, of the <hi>Odium</hi> under which the Name of Chriſt, his Cauſe, People and Ways do lie, as it were buried) as alſo of the exceeding Contempt which the wonderful and excellent Operations of God are brought into, even thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Wonders which the Nations have been Spectators and Witneſſes of, and wherein your hands have been partly inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in. We cannot (after much ſerious conſideration, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord, many of us, both together and apart) but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your hands the enſuing Teſtimony, which (however you may look thereon) is no more than Neceſſity exacts from us for the clearing of our own ſouls from guilt, and diſcharging of our duty to God and Men. Therefore we earneſtly wiſh you to peruſe and weigh it, as in the ſight of God, with a calm and Chriſtian-like Spirit, and harden not your neck againſt the Truth, as you will anſwer it to the great Judge, before whoſe impartial Tribunal you (as well as we) ſhall be very ſhortly cited, to give an account of things done in the body; whether good or evil, where the true Motives and Ends of all your Actions will be evident, where no Apologie will be accepted of, for your ſlighting and blaſpheming of the Spirit of God, nor for the hard meaſure you give his people, by Reproaches, Impriſonments, and other Oppreſſions; and, where Pride, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Laſciviouſneſs, and Changing of Principles, and forſaking the good ways of Juſtice and Holineſs, will not have the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>left rag of pretence to hide them from the eyes of the Judge. Which things (whatſoever you ſay for your ſelf) are (even at, preſent to be read in your forehead) and have produced moſt ſad effects every where; Eſpecially (1) in filling of the Saints hearts and faces with an inexpreſſible grief and ſhame; and (2) the ſtopping (at leaſt) the ſtrong current of their prayers, which was once for you, if not the turning thereof directly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115669:5"/>againſt you: To theſe we might adde, (3) the hardning of wicked men, yea the refreſhing and juſtifying of them in their evil doings and ſpeakings againſt the Goſpel, Name and Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; And laſtly, Gods ſignal withdrawing from you and your Deſigns. Oh that then you would lie down in the duſt, and acknowledge your Iniquity, and return unto the Lord by unfeigned Repentance, doing your firſt work; and that you would make haſte to do ſo, leſt Gods fury break forth like fire upon you, and there be no quenching of it. This would rejoyce us much, as being real Well-wiſhers to your Souls everlaſting Happineſs, though we muſt with equal Pity and Deteſtation, Declare againſt your Deſigns and Way.</p>

               <p n="1">I. That the Sins and preſent condition of this Nation holds paralel in many things with the old Iſraelites, after the mighty wonders of God ſhewed unto them in their great deliverance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For inſtance,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">II. That bleſſed Cauſe, and thoſe noble Principles propounded and proſecuted by the old Parliament, and the Good, people of this Nation (in the maintaining of which God did miraculouſly appear) are now altogether laid aſide and loſt, and another Cauſe and Intereſt (quite contrary, as we conceive) eſpouſed and maintained; for then the Advancement of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Extirpation of Popery, and Popiſh Innovations, the Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty of the Subjects, and an equal Diſtribution of Juſtice were declared and fought for; and Tyranny, Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, Arbitrarineſs, Deſtroying the Priviledges of Parliaments, we declared and engaged againſt: But how far ſome men have now receded from, and acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, to the diſhonor of God, Scandal of Religion, great grief of many faithful men, and the ſtrengthning of the wicked in their principles, and juſtifying their practices, we leave to the conſideration of all thoſe that are ſober and wiſe.</p>

Moreover, the unadviſed and unwarrantable changing of the Government, and a ſwearing thereunto, doth (as we judge) put a Neceſſity upon the chief Undertaker thereof, to overthrow the very foundation of a Commonwealth, and to maintain the things comprized in the ſaid Inſtrument (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right or wrong) And to turn the very edge and dint of his Sword againſt the faces and bowels of ſuch, as ſhould or ſhall declare their Conſciences contrary thereunto.</p>

Notwithſtanding all the fair pretences and promiſes of Reformation, yet what abominable and horrible Impieties, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Oppreſſion, are there couched and covered under this new Form, from the head to the tail (as the Prophet ſaith) treading in the footſteps of their predeceſſors; witneſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Honors, Profits, Cuſtoms, Benefits, Tenths and Firſt-fruits, coming in formerly to the Crown; the Exalting of Sons, Servants, Friends and Favorites (though ſome of them known to be wicked men) to the higheſt places and greateſt preferments, which the good Rulers of old, as <hi>Gideon, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and others did not do, becauſe of the fear of the Lord, &amp; the bondage which was heavy upon the people.

               <p n="7">VII.

               <p>Laſtly, We do Declare and publiſh to all from our very hearts and ſouls, That thoſe of us that hand any hand in joyning with the Parliament and Army heretofore, had no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the late King or his party, ſave as they were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Lord Chriſt, his Kingdom and people, hinderers of his work, and Oppreſſors of the Nation; and that it never came into our hearts to think or intend the pulling down of one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſet up another, or one Unrighteous Power to permit another; but as we aymed (primarily) at the Glory of God, ſo likewiſe at the general good of the Nation, and particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and juſt Liberty of every man: And it grieves us that any juſt cauſe is given them to ſtumble at Profeſſors, or complain that they are deprived of their Freedom, and ſeveral ways more oppreſſed, than in the days of the wickedſt Kings.</p>
               <p>We do alſo believe in our hearts, That (though the wors;t
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115669:8"/>things are not without Gods permiſſion and providence) yet that this Government is not of Gods Approbation, or taken up by his counſel, or according to his Word; and therefore we do utterly diſclaim having any hand or heart in it: And for the Contrivers and Undertakers thereof, we ſuſpect and judge them to be great Tranſgreſſors therein, and ſo much the more, becauſe they are Profeſſors of Religion, &amp; Declarers, Engagers, and Fighters againſt the very things they now practice: And it is moſt evident to us, that they thereby build again what before they did deſtroy; and in ſo doing they render Themſelves, the Cauſe, Religion, Name and People of God, abominable to Heathens, Papiſts, and profane Enemies; which is a grief to our ſouls to conſider.</p>
               <p>We do alſo deteſt the practices of theſe men, in impriſoning the Saints of God for their Conſciences and Teſtimony, and juſt men, who ſtand for Moral and juſt Principles, and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Nation and people; and their breaking of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to effect their own Deſigns.</p>

            <p>I Intend not a captious Anſwer to this <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Paper,</hi> but a friendly Treaty with the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> and ſuch a Treaty as may be a ſervice of Love to all honeſt mindes that are offended at the preſent Government or Governors: My endeavor ſhall be, either to remove thoſe Offences out of the way, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large mens mindes, that they may walk in a way without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

            <p>The Title is, <hi>A Word for God,</hi> or <hi>A Teſtimony on Truths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, from ſeveral Churches, &amp;c. againſt Wickedneſs in High-places:</hi> 1 The Inſcription, <hi>A Word for God,</hi> did at firſt grieve me, I thought the name of God was miſplac'd and abus'd; Wit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd its ſervice, to ſhevv the vanity and falſity of the Title, Scripture would have confuted it and pull'd it down: But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the <hi>Name of God,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of either of theſe to oppoſe; but chuſes rather to admit of your Title, and in the ſimplicity of what Light I have, to Treat with you concerning it.</p>
            <p>I will admit, that God hath a Controverſie with thoſe you teſtiſie againſt, becauſe they have ſinn'd againſt him; they have departed from him, and he ſeems to forſake them; and that you in this Diviſion, are <hi>for God, againſt his People</hi> and <hi>their Sins:</hi> This, I think, is the beſt of your caſe. God withholds his Grace and Preſence from his people, and ſuffers them to wander in Darkneſs and Trouble, and gives this reaſon, <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated 'twixt me and you, &amp;c.</hi> You finde this, and ſeparate from them too, and <hi>teſtiſie</hi> your <hi>diſlike</hi> of them, and deteſtation of their ways, and plead for God and his juſtice
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115669:10"/>againſt them: And this, you think, cannot but be holy, and ſafe, and your <hi>duty to God.</hi> Before we queſtion this, I ſhall propound another Caſe; which, though it differ from yours, yet it may have ſomething in it like yours, which may give light to you, or at leaſt offer ſomething to you, which you have not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</p>
            <p>'Tis the Caſe of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. The Iſraelites were at that time great ſinners: <hi>The man of God,</hi> ſo indeed he was, did oppoſe their ſins; for the diſcharge of his duty, he was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life; and to ſave himſelf, is forc'd to ſay, and to hide himſelf in the wilderneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. where he was ſad to think how <hi>croſs</hi> things went to his <hi>miniſtry:</hi> For, though God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd for him againſt his enemies, yet they went on ſtill, and wickedneſs prevail'd, which was more than he could bear; and therefore in a paſſion deſired <hi>he might die:</hi> Being overcome, and even ſpent with the evil of the times and diſcontent, he is by an Angel refreſhed, <hi>who feeds him twice, v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. and 'twas ſuch miraculous food, that <hi>he walked forty days and forty nights in the ſtrength of that meat, ver.</hi> 8. and ſo came <hi>to Horeb, the mount of God.</hi> He hath left Iſrael, and ſo by the help of Angels, being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily aſſiſted, he arrives at <hi>Gods mount,</hi> and waits upon God there, where at firſt he declar'd his Covenant with his people, by giving them his righteous Law. <hi>Such a man,</hi> ſo <hi>aſſiſted,</hi> in <hi>ſuch a way;</hi> you cannot think it an injury to you, to be ſet by him, though you meet with a reproof there: While he was here in a Cave, <hi>the word of the Lord came to him, What doſt thou here Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah?</hi> This is not thy place, thou art not in thy work; thy Miniſtry is hot, thy Spirit active, but I intended it to be imploy'd <hi>in</hi> and <hi>with</hi> Iſrael, not <hi>againſt</hi> them; to keep alive that little good that is in them, not to ſeparate from them, and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elijah</hi> anſwers, and to ſave himſelf from the reproof, ſays, <hi>I have been very jealous for the Lord God of Hoſts:</hi> That what he had done, was <hi>for the Lord God,</hi> and that in great zeal he had left them that left the Lord, Why ſhould he continue any longer with the children of Iſrael? His heart was <hi>for God,</hi> for <hi>they have forſaken thy Covenant;</hi> not onely broken their own Covenants, but thine too; <hi>Thrown down thine Altars: The Name of Chriſt and his Cauſe lies as it Were buried; They
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115669:11"/>have killed thy Prophets and Miniſters for their Teſtimony; and I, I onely am left:</hi> He thought there was none true, becauſe none of his temper; and none in Iſrael, becauſe none in his cave; <hi>And they ſeek my life, to take it away;</hi> I muſt leave them or dye, I can't live amongſt them, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Then God calls him forth of his private hole, <hi>his Cave,</hi> into which he was retired, and from his melancholick, jealous, narrow, fearful Spirit, where he could ſee nothing but himſelf and his own dark apprehenſions, to conſider God in his ſeveral ways and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Go forth, and ſtand upon the mount before the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rd:</hi> And to diſcover to him, of <hi>what Spirit he is,</hi> ſhews him himſelf, and what things or ſpirits work or act before God, and yet God not in them: <hi>A great and ſtrong wind rends the mountain, and breaks the rocks in pieces; after the wind an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> more terrible then the wind; and <hi>after that a fire,</hi> more fierce than the earthquake: He expected to finde God in theſe, but could not; therefore of each 'tis ſaid, <hi>God was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire:</hi> He had been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in ſuch kinde of Diſpenſations, which did either threaten or execute fierce wrath, but men were not converted by ſuch violent and terrible works. At this he was troubled, and thinks that Iſrael, in refuſing ſuch mighty things, had for ever refus'd the Lord himſelf; but he was miſtaken if he ſo thought, for <hi>God was not in theſe things:</hi> Neither was he himſelf moved by either of theſe, till the fourth came, which was <hi>a ſtill ſmall voice;</hi> He looked upon the other, but finding not God there, his very nature retired from them, being boyſtrous and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: But as ſoon as the <hi>ſtill ſmall voice</hi> came, which was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and gentle, of his own nature, heard beſt, and underſtood beſt <hi>within,</hi> at home in his very heart, this was one with him; and preſently <hi>he wraps his face in his mantle, and goes forth, and ſtood in the entring in of the cave:</hi> This <hi>ſtill ſmall voice</hi> onely had power upon his heart, to draw it forth from it ſelf to God. All men, good and bad, that are turn'd aſide from God by any kinde of Luſt or Paſſion, run into ſome ſecret dark Den, where they lie: Now all Legal bluſtring Miniſtry's, may for a while affect or affright, but draw not the creature out from himſelf, where he is lodg'd, till God ſends a <hi>ſtill ſmall voice</hi> into his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115669:11"/>heart, which is <hi>the word in thy heart and mouth.</hi> This doth a little convince <hi>Elijah,</hi> That God was another thing than he for the preſent apprehended him; and therefore, aſham'd of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelft, <hi>he wraps his face in his mantle,</hi> and yields to go forth to God; but is not yet fully convinc'd of his error. When men are ſtrong and high in their ſpirits, wherein they think they are <hi>for God,</hi> 'tis hard to convince them, That their Zeal is <hi>not for God,</hi> but for their own Miniſtry and way, for their own Lives and Honors: When God had moved him a little nearer to himſelf, he falls upon him again, <hi>What doeſt thou here, Elijah?</hi> or, What haſt thou to do here? Thou art an Iſraelite, one with them, of the ſame nature, haſt ſin in thee as well as they, and they righteouſneſs as thou haſt: Why doeſt thou ſeparate from them, and become an Enemy to them? He ſtands ſtiffly for his way that it was <hi>Zeal for God,</hi> ſaying the ſame words that he ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 14 <hi>A conſident and froward Spirit:</hi> God find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo ſixt in this angry way, as not to be inſtructed by the ſight of God, he leads him forth into a work ſuitable to his minde; he was full of wrath, and therefore God imploys him in a way wherein he might give him vent: If nothing will pleaſe thee, but to plague Iſrael my people for their ſins, <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhall bring it forth, but not adminiſter it by his own hand, <hi>Go on thy way to Damaſcus, &amp; anoint Hazael king of Syria:</hi> what a terrible malignant and cruel enemy to <hi>poor Iſrael</hi> this <hi>Hazael</hi> proved, is afterward declar'd, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.12. Yet his name ſignifies <hi>viſions of God,</hi> or <hi>ſeeing of God;</hi> he might have his ſtrength from the ſame ground that <hi>Elijah</hi> had: <hi>Seeing</hi> what <hi>God</hi> had done to Iſrael, and how Iſrael had ſinn'd againſt God, and that <hi>ſeeing</hi> upon this God had forſaken Iſrael, from this his Sword might he whetted againſt Iſrael: And this is the firſt-born of <hi>Elijah</hi> his fiery Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>And Iehu ſhalt thou anoint to be King over Iſrael;</hi> a man terrible enough againſt Idolatry, againſt <hi>Ahab, Iezebel,</hi> and the Prophets of <hi>Baal;</hi> but <hi>conſtant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> ſo his name ſignifies, and ſo he was, though a great Zelot againſt the corruption in Court, and in the Prophets, and that according to the <hi>Word of the Lord;</hi> yet he had an eye to his own Honor: And this was <hi>Elijah</hi> his ſecond Son, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there was much of <hi>ſelf</hi> in <hi>Elijah; I have been very zealous:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115669:12"/>I, I onely am left, and they ſeek my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His third command was, <hi>Eliſha ſhalt thou anoint Prophet in thy room:</hi> The meaning was this, this Spirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> was of too violent a temper; and therefore, like <hi>Iohn,</hi> it muſt <hi>decreaſe;</hi> he muſt give over to another, to <hi>Eliſha, the ſalvation of God,</hi> ſo his name ſignifies: And 'tis the beſt of this Spirit, it ſpends its fierceneſs, and is at laſt, being weary of it ſelf, willing to reſign to him, whoſe nature is, not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>ſave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But poor Iſrael, that needs ſo many Rods, needs ſome Pity too, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Him that eſcapeth the Sword of Hazael, ſhall Iehu ſtay; and him that eſcapeth the Sword of Iehu, ſhall Eliſha ſlay;</hi> Slain and ſlain: yet at laſt, he that ſaves, ſlays moſt, ſlays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſlay Self, Death and Enmity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>I have left me ſeven thouſand in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the knees that have not bowed unto Baal,</hi> &amp;c. A compleat number, a <hi>ſufficient Army</hi> to carry on his work; Theſe are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to me,</hi> kept by God in ſecret, whoſe hearts were inwardly and truly reſerv'd to the Lord, ſo ſafe, that they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him.</p>
            <p>Now in all this it appears, That this Man of God was in a dark Spirit, for the preſent, in a high diſcontent; for he thought he had been <hi>f r God,</hi> but was not: Thoſe things wherein he had been exercis'd, he over-valued them, and his Miniſtry with them; for <hi>God was not</hi> in them, but in the <hi>ſtill voice:</hi> He was <hi>much out</hi> alſo concerning Iſrael, he thought they had been utterly loſt, no good leſt amongſt them; but was <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> ſhort in his meaſure.</p>
            <p>Leſt you think I have miſrepreſented this Caſe of <hi>Elijah,</hi> you ſhall ſee it cenſured in the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Hath G d caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his people? God forbid:</hi> Some, that meaſure things by their own private and ſeparated Spirit, think he hath; but <hi>God forbid,</hi> that there ſhould be no more Mercy, nor Patience <hi>in God,</hi> than there is in the beſt of men. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Wot ye not what the Scripture ſaith of Elias, how he makes interceſſion againſt Iſrael? ſaying,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Lord, they have killed thy Prophets, digged down thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and I am left alone.</hi> He, though a Prophet, was in a great error; in ſtead of interceding for, he intercedes againſt Iſrael: it mindes me of a Clauſe in <hi>this Letter, The ſtrong current of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115669:12"/>their Prayers, which was once for you, the turning thereof againſt you:</hi> But this is not Prophet-like, 'tis rather like the worſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Spirit, like the <hi>Accuſer.</hi> —And obſerve, That ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring againſt Iſraels ſin, is plain <hi>interceding</hi> againſt them; 'tis indeed, to be inſtant and earneſt for their deſtruction: This I deſire the Subſcribers to mark: And this Judgment, made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome evil actions and outward appearance, by man darkned with paſſion, was very far from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>the Election of his Grace.</hi> A humane and Legal Spirit, under a Covenant of Works, provok'd into Enmity, is the nature of this Spirit; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> brings it in here, whatever it pretended to be zeal <hi>for God,</hi> yet 'twas againſt <hi>God himſelf,</hi> and againſt the liberty of his <hi>Election,</hi> and the Freeneſs of his <hi>Grace:</hi> I'll but apply the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Even ſo then at this time alſo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It may be you will deny the Application of <hi>Elijahs</hi> Caſe to yours, and will not admit your Adverſaries to be <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and I may alſo deny you to miniſter in the Holineſs, Power, Truth and Evidence that <hi>Elijah</hi> miniſtred in: Therefore I chuſe rather to wave the paralel; onely let this <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Elijah</hi> be conſider'd abſolutely by it ſelf, and it doth ſufficiently evince theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions:</p>
            <p n="1">I 'Tis very common, for humane Paſſion to intrude it ſelf into Gods ſervice, yea
'tis very ambitious of being his Attorney to ſpeak <hi>for God;</hi> and while he ſeems to advance God, 'tis to prefer it ſelf: For, who would not be on his ſide, where he may Spoil, Plunder, Revenge freely.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If God be but <hi>angry a little,</hi> he will not want ſome to <hi>help it forward;</hi> he needs not now the Devil, nor <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to miniſter Wrath, he may finde enough Miniſters or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in Iſrael will ſue for the imployment; ſpecially if it be againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> he will ſinde Religious Friends, that will handle him cruelly enough.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That if Man be imployed in any Miniſtry, wherein there ſeems to be any light or power, as coming <hi>from God;</hi> he is apt to magnifie it above meaſure, and to account of it as <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> to expect the ſame Honor and Subjection that is due to the Lord, though it be but a <hi>Whiffler,</hi> one that goes before to make way for him.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115669:13"/>
            <p n="4">IV. If this Miniſtry obtain not, and his way be refus'd, he is apt to be highly diſpleas'd, and be fooliſhly angry beyond all reaſon; though all the works of man are to vaniſh, and to give place to that which is <hi>perfect,</hi> yet man commonly is ſo angry, that he will not out-live his Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="5">V. But fooliſhly adhering to his Miniſtry, though it be of Sin and Condemnation; when God <hi>repents of his anger,</hi> as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily he doth, he over-eagerly ingaging himſelf, is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and ſo loſt in it: Fleſhly Zeal is of a very ſlight and combuſtible nature, and if it get into the fire of Gods anger againſt Sin, rarely comes off; but over-acting in it, is commonly ſcorch'd and burnt up by it, and ſo may happily get to Heaven in a <hi>fiery chariot</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, but is altogether unfit for any ſaving or healing work. When Mans Enmity and Paſſion hath gotten into Gods Name and Cauſe, if God ſhould not withhold Spirit and Power from it, and render it vain, it would make mad work, deſtroy all but themſelves; and therfore there is a neceſſity of turning it home upon it ſelf, that it may hurt none but it ſelf, which is a good and juſt end of it. Theſe things well conſider'd, might make men afraid to intermeddle with Divine diſpleaſure againſt others Sins, in which men are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſo buſie, as if there were no other Religion.</p>
            <p>But ſure there is a more <hi>excellent way:</hi> When God was very angry, and juſtly, with Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Let me alone,</hi> ſays he to <hi>Moſes, that my wrath may wax hot againſt them;</hi> this was a good Spirit, to interpoſe, and to offer <hi>to be blotted out of the book of God,</hi> ver. 32. rather than God ſhould deſtroy his people: Thus Chriſt doth for us all, he is willing to become a ſinner with us, and there ſuffer the diſpleaſure of God as the worſt of ſinners, rather than ſuffer the wrath of God to break forth upon us: If he ſhould take part with <hi>God</hi> againſt <hi>ſinners,</hi> what would become of you? If he be an Advocate <hi>for God</hi> and his Juſtice, and not for Tranſgreſſors, alas how miſerable were we all! This might a little incline mens hearts, and bend them towards thoughts of Love, Pity, and interceding for others, though tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p>You ſuperſcribe your Letter, <hi>To Oliver Cromwel, Captain General of all the Forces of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115669:13"/>This Title is a fair one, and ſo different from that which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily given him, that it cannot eſcape my Animadverſions; and it contains in it the head of the Quarrel, Whether <hi>Captain General of the Forces of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, or <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Commonwealth of England, &amp;c.</hi> If we could finde one the true nature and inward reaſon of both theſe, we might clear your underſtandings, and ſo in time compoſe the difference: I ſhall a little conſider the Perſon, and then his Place or Title.</p>
            <p>'Tis better dealing with Things than Perſons, they are ſo nice and curious, that a man can hardly handle them without offending, eſpecially if they be Great ones; for there is a double temptation attends one in it: 1. To Flattery, to pleaſe the Court: and 2. Of Detraction, to pleaſe the People: However, this Perſon <hi>the Protector,</hi> being the chief ſubject of the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Paper,</hi> I cannot avoid ſpeaking my Apprehenſions of him; and being ſenſible of ſome ingenuity and equality of minde in it, I ſhall do it without Apologie.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely give you my Obſervation of his Original, what he was before theſe times, and then what ſhare he hath had in theſe late publick Tranſactions:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, this great Man is riſen from a very low and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition; one that hath ſuffer'd very great troubles of ſoul, lying a long time under ſore terrors and temptations, and at the ſame time in a very low condition for outward things: in this School of Afflictions he was kept, till he had learned the Leſſon of the Croſs, till his Will was broken into Submiſſion to the Will of God, &amp;c. Religion that is thus laid into the ſoul with the <hi>hammer</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> is ordinarily more ſolid, &amp; more uſeful than what comes in onely by Light into the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. I have had opportunity to meaſure (as well as I was able) moſt men that have appear'd in any eminency in theſe times, and have always obſerv'd his Spirit, as to the <hi>active</hi> or <hi>practical</hi> part of Religion, as through, as full, as ſound, and as hearty in it as any, yea more: it may be, what I have now to ſay, is but my Fancy; but take it amongſt other things, That the time of his extreme ſuffering was, when this Cauſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in which we are now ingaged, was at its loweſt ebb; and that, when he came forth into comfort of Spirit, and inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115669:14"/>of eſtate, Religion began then to ſpring forth into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt divided from the Kingdom and Nation, though it was low, yet it began to look abroad, and to ſeek either a new ſtate here, or in other Regions; and ſo he ſuffer'd and roſe, or ſprung forth with this cauſe, as if he had one life with it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, His maner of appearing in <hi>publike Imployment</hi> hath been viſible to all: <hi>publike work</hi> ſeem'd to be exceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him, his ſoul was one with it, which made him act with more vigor than other men, and ſo conſtant and ſteddy to it, as not to be diſcouraged by difficulties, nor taken off either by <hi>offence</hi> or by <hi>opinions</hi> of other ways, as many eminent men have been, a main pillar of the ſtrength of it in all its changes; I muſt be excuſed if I tell my thoughts of him, I am the freer in it, becauſe they have continued with me in a long time of offence and prejudice concerning him; There hath to me appear'd in him a ſingular ſpirit of Brightneſs, Clearneſs, Largeneſs and Self-denial, of care for, and love to the cauſe of Religion and honeſt men, as much above other men, as <hi>Saul</hi> was higher than the people in ſtature of body; for which I did conclude before ever he had any Command in Chief, that if ever this Cauſe did ſucceed, he would be the <hi>Head</hi> of it: He had an honeſty, an integrity, a nobleneſs in him, which did attract and unite ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men to him; a love and lovelineſs in which affections of good people did concenter, and a largeneſs to receive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all honeſt men of differing judgements, and this He did by the vertue and dignity of his Minde, long before he had the advantage of Supream Command to do it, which was a proof to me that his inward worth, not any outward accident, hath given him his preeminence.</p>
            <p>To his great induſtry, faithfulneſs and wiſdom in buſineſs, he hath been always attended with a ſingular bleſſing of Succeſs in all his Affairs, and that conſtant both in the Field and Council, and often times in ſome great works the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Arm</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> hath been reveal'd to him; and with him (according to the maner of Gods ſpeaking to his people in theſe days, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in to the heart ſome Scriptures with great power and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) whereby his Faith hath been ſtrengthned to attempt great things; As he hath been often guided by the word of the Lord
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115669:14"/>in his great Undertakings, ſo I do think, and have particular reaſon to believe, that in that which is ſo much offenſive to men, <hi>viz.</hi> The breaking of Civil and Worldly Powers, he hath had the ſame Authority and Word of Command.</p>
            <p>Conſider now ſuch a perſon riſing from great afflictions, from whence he comes ſanctified by grace, called forth into pablique action, and therein appearing in largeneſs, integrity and courage; aſſiſted with the <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>bleſsing</hi> of God, guided and ſtrengthned by the <hi>arm</hi> and <hi>word</hi> of the Lord, which above all ſets the cleareſt ſtamp of Majeſty upon a man, according to the words of Chriſt John 10.35. <hi>If he called them gods to whom the word of the Lord came:</hi> Theſe things together are certainly a foundation, yea, the ſubſtance of greater and truer Honor, than theſe laſt Ages have had experience of.</p>
            <p>Yet he hath no reaſon at all to be proud, nor we much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to boaſt of him; for though theſe are excellent things, yet they have been ſhadowed and ſullied with very great weakneſs, that doth much eclipſe their luſtre; for beſides the dirt that malice caſt upon him, and the pollution contracted from the nature of his work, which hath been deſtroying work, and ſo impure; beſides theſe, I ſay, there is perſonal weakneſs, raſh paſſions, ſudden ingaging for, and as ſudden turning from things, which ſhews want of fore-ſight, incontinency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of minde; ſome violent ſtrains and leaps which have ſtretch'd conſcience and credit, large promiſing to oblige par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perſons, and too ſhort performance to give ſatisfaction, which ſhew a minde not ſtanding firmly upon its own baſis of truth, but carried off into looſer ways of policy; And though the tottering ſtate of things may ſeem to excuſe it, yet certainly ſuch actings ſo diſproportionable to the truth and faithfulneſs of God, do more ſhake him, and with him the publique peace, than any thing in the world.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe (or if not theſe, what ever other weakneſs may cleave to him) I muſt prefer <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> in <hi>querpo,</hi> with the ſtamp of God upon him, before <hi>Oliver Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> and all His train of Greatneſs; and that His naked perſon, with what God hath done in him, and by him, hath really more dignity &amp; majeſty upon it, than if he had with his Protectorſhip
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115669:15"/>fetch'd from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> all the Honors and Titles of all the kings of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore I think, what ever may be fancied, the Subſcribers have done him no real injury, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>To Oliver Cromwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the perſon, and I am glad I have done with it, I may ſay of my commending him, being a great perſon, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his commending himſelf, 2 Cor. 12.11. <hi>I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fool in glorying, ye have compelled me:</hi> It looks fooliſhly and uncomely to me, and it may be to others more; but I have been <hi>compell'd to it,</hi> to teſtifie the truth againſt mens ignorance and malice.</p>
            <p>For the Title given him, <hi>Captain General of all the Forces in</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, I am not offended at it, for though ſome may think His Highneſs is degraded by it, from <hi>Protector</hi> to <hi>General;</hi> yet he that will look beyond that vail of diſcontent, that for the preſent covers your faces, and will look into the more inward reaſon of your mindes, in retaining this Title of <hi>General,</hi> will not be much troubled at it, though he be very zealous of His Highneſs honor: That which I think either is or ſhould be your intent in it, is this: if you conſider;</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>the Forces</hi> and Armies <hi>in England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are the ſole and proper intereſt of the godly party, being at firſt rais'd and ſince mantain'd for the ſafety of good people, their ſpirits have moſt freely and lively acted in them, and been the chief ſtrength of them; ſo that the Forces are theirs, or rather they are vertually and truly the <hi>Forces of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland and Ireland,</hi> and that in diſtinction from, and oppoſition to all other people of the Nation; of which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt party may ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Reuben,</hi> Gen. 49.3. <hi>Reuben thou art my firſt-born, the beginning of my ſtrength:</hi> This military Power is the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> the <hi>beginning of ſtrength</hi> that God hath given his people in the earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſuppoſe you may conſider, that this Power of the Militia you now have, or are, is as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Reuben, The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.</hi> The abſoluteſt and perfecteſt power in the earth, having the ſubſtance of all Government in it, it gives both reaſon and being of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Safety,</hi> &amp; the name alſo; whence all Governments are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115669:15"/>called <hi>Powers</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> in ſcripture: and that which makes it very ſuitable to this ſeaſon, that having the <hi>Forces</hi> in our hands, we have our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> ſecured, and ſo may quietly wait for more light, and are free to diſpoſe of our ſelves according to the beſt light and underſtanding that ſhall be brought forth amongſt us; which is no ſmall mercy, if we had hearts to improve it, to be once free from all the yokes that were upon our necks by the blinde and malignant Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Nations, and ſet free to follow the beſt light God ſhall ſhine forth to us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have reaſon to conſider, that as all former Powers are diſſolv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The Power of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> by their irreconcileable Breaches and continued Wars; ſo this Title of <hi>Captain General of all the Forces of England, Scotland and Ireland,</hi> doth not onely extinguiſh the three diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and their Governments, and ſubject them to theſe <hi>Forces,</hi> but lays waſte the pales whereby they were formerly divided, and turns them all into one <hi>Militia,</hi> under the command of <hi>one General;</hi> for the Command of the <hi>Forces</hi> of all three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is both a greater Power, and of another kinde, and muſt needs ſwallow up the three particular Governments into it ſelf, which is a large field that we are brought into: that now the <hi>General of theſe Forces</hi> hath an unlimited Power to <hi>enlarge his Militia,</hi> to take in all <hi>honeſt men</hi> if he pleaſe, and to give them <hi>what pay</hi> he judges reaſonable; and in order to it, to <hi>raiſe what money</hi> he pleaſes in the three Nations, to reſtrain and <hi>ſecure</hi> what <hi>perſons</hi> he ſuſpects to be Diſturbers of his Army and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to inflict what <hi>puniſhment</hi> he pleaſes upon his <hi>enemies,</hi> to make what <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> he will for the ſecuring theſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and to <hi>repeal</hi> all Laws that are againſt their Safety and Quiet: Theſe things are natural and eſſential to a <hi>General in</hi> and <hi>with</hi> his Army, which will be accounted abſurd for either <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to do: ſo royal and abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the hands of an <hi>honeſt General</hi> intruſted for, and in fellowſhip with the whole <hi>Party,</hi> in a capacity diſtinct from the Nations, is a thing worth remembring.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You cannot but conſider that the <hi>General</hi> hath been the chief Inſtrument of getting the ſword into the hands
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115669:16"/>of honeſt men: You cannot but remember how induſtrious he was to have an <hi>honeſt Regiment,</hi> then an <hi>honeſt Army,</hi> at leaſt under <hi>honeſt Officers,</hi> how he ſent for <hi>honeſt men</hi> from all parts of the Nation, and imployed and encouraged them; and this favor he ſhewed to <hi>honeſt men,</hi> as <hi>honeſt men</hi> without partiality; when he had gathered them together, pleaded their Cauſe againſt their enemies: You know how conſtantly the Work proſper'd in their hands under his Conduct, and how they have been kept in union, and in order and diſcipline by his Wiſdom and Government; ſo that if the honeſt people of the three Nations have obtain'd an outward and viſible Power in the earth, and to be above their enemies, ſafe and ſecure, the <hi>General</hi> is the immediate Patron and Father of it, it being firſt conceived, and ſince brought forth and cheriſh'd, principally (as by an inſtrument) by his Counſel and Conduct; and if he that gave life to this Body, ſhould not uphold and preſerve it, it would in all probability fall into diviſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; therefore you have reaſon to challenge him to be <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all the Forces,</hi> they conſiſting by him, and <hi>we</hi> in and by them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This his Authority is ſo bright and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that none can deny it, nor you, or any honeſt man a ſnare in it: This Title <hi>Captain General of all the Forces,</hi> and ſo of all the Armies of <hi>honeſt men</hi> in the three Nations; it hath been the product of Providence, after our many years wars, openly declared and ſeal'd to by the Lord in all parts of the three Nations; therefore if you had but united your ſelves to it, and taken in the <hi>intereſt</hi> and relation of <hi>all honeſt men,</hi> which is your and their due (and muſt be implied, though not expreſs'd) it is then, I think, the honorableſt Title in the world, a mercy beyond all we could expect, had we eyes to ſee it, and hearts to make a ſober uſe of it.</p>
            <p>I judge theſe very fundamental Conſiderations: Firſt, The union of all honeſt men to the Armies as their own. Secondly, The excellency and freedom of Military power. Thirdly, That the Forces of the three Nations being united under <hi>one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> are a Power larger and greater than their former civil and divided States, and fully comprehends them in it ſelf.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115669:16"/>Fourthly, That the <hi>General</hi> is the Natural Father of this power. Fifthly, And all this the workmanſhip of Providence, juſtified by Succeſs in the face of all the world; which put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would make a good Ground for us to unite and ſtand upon.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why you refuſe the common Title of <hi>Protector,</hi> is I ſuppoſe this, That as <hi>General</hi> he ſtood in a ſpecial relation to <hi>honeſt men,</hi> as divided from their enemies and all others in <hi>an Army,</hi> where you expect a more open, friendly and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious converſe with him: You think he hath by being <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland,</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd this Diſtinction, and brought you into the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Nation, and now every man hath as much ſhare in him as you or we: your diſcontent is jealouſie, leſt your <hi>Lord General</hi> ſhould forſake the wife of his youth, the honeſt <hi>people of the Nation,</hi> his ſiſter, his ſpouſe, in the morning of her beauty, and commit adultery with that rotten harlot, Old worldly Power and Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>And that he ſhould ſeem to deſert you, and that <hi>general</hi> and unlimited Power that he had with you, and you with him, and this won and worn in the face of the three Nations, and take up a limited Power, a broken clipt Title, maim'd and imperfect, and that a Muſhrom, a thing that riſes in a night, none knows from whence; that he ſhould carry his and your conquering Sword, and hang it up amongſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and fetch out of the old Records, or the Lawyers pates, a ceremonial empty thing without ſpirit or vigor, and therewith wrap up and invelope himſelf from the converſe and enjoyment of his own body and ſpouſe: Now in this I confeſs, I would a little indulge your jealouſie, though it be mixed with an unſeemly rage, yet I hope there is love at the bottom, and a ſenſe that His Highneſs hath deveſted himſelf of too much of that Greatneſs and Power which he had, and which is neceſſary to uphold us and our cauſe in that ſtate into which he hath brought us: But withal let us conſider it is an error that deſerves pity, it may be he intended it as an act of humility, not of diſloyalty, that he conſidered himſelf as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115669:17"/>perſon, not as a <hi>General</hi> intruſted with all the Honor won by <hi>honeſt men</hi> in theſe wars, and if he hath waſted his ſtrength and might by it, he will quickly feel the want of it, and will be ready to entertain a loving invitation back again; and if in ſtead of ſuing a Divorce, your <hi>Letter and Paper</hi> had been a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Challenge and Claim of your right to him, it might for ought I know have had a very excellent effect.</p>
            <p>Meeting with theſe two conſiderable Queſtions in your Title, I could not but give them as ſerious a Conſideration as I was able, in hope it may help to clear our Work for the future: I ſhall now haſten to your Letter.</p>

            <p>IN the begining of your Letter you ſpeak of <hi>A Sudden, Strange, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexpected alteration of Government,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the great aſtoniſhment,</hi> &amp;c.

               </gap>d: When the Remnant of the old Parliament was taken away, that wherein the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> in Calling, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> in Chuſing, met in one Conſtitution; And the then <hi>General</hi> and his <hi>Council, private perſons,</hi> exerciſe the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and meerly out of their own wills create a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> Now all <hi>Civil</hi> Power is <hi>changed</hi> into <hi>Military,</hi> and that triumphing in the higheſt Abſoluteneſs, as if the Sword were the onely Lord of the world, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of Government; as if it gave the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi>

The next <hi>change</hi> was rather downward again, into an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which ſets up <hi>One</hi> as Supreme, and a <hi>Parliament choſen</hi> by the <hi>People;</hi> this is not altogether ſo ſtrange to <hi>England</hi> as the former: Now which of theſe you mean, I know not; to complain of the former <hi>change</hi> from the <hi>long Parliament</hi> to the <hi>little Parliament,</hi> is againſt your own <hi>Intereſt;</hi> and to complain of a <hi>change</hi> from a <hi>Parliament impos'd,</hi> to a <hi>Parliament choſen,</hi> is againſt the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the People: I will not trouble you, to reſolve which of theſe <hi>changes</hi> doth affect you moſt: Many are offended at the taking away the <hi>old Parliament,</hi> and that <hi>Cauſe</hi> you ſeem to undertake; whether it be really your Intereſt, I'll not determine: I ſhall onely give you and others that are unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with <hi>that act,</hi> my thoughts concerning it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>long Parliament</hi> deſerves to be mention'd with much Honor, by all Honeſt men in the Nation that did adhere to it; for that it had in it many ſound and worthy men, and was a long time a Bulwark that kept off Slavery and Deſtruction from breaking in upon us, in many a hard brunt and deſperate aſſult; yet the removing of them at that time, might be no injury to them or us:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they then ſtood, was no <hi>Legal</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, nor had they Right to the <hi>Government,</hi> by our Laws: What Right had they to take away the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> by whoſe <hi>Authority</hi> they were made a <hi>Parliament?</hi> Or what Right had they to take away the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution Ancienter than themſelves? When this was done, what juſt Power had they to conſtitute themſelves a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</hi> There was no act of the people that either made them ſo, or gave them power to make themſelves ſo; they had no ſuch power inherent in themſelves, neither could they ever manifeſt any ſuch ſtamp of Majeſty ſet upon them by God and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now, if the <hi>Parliament</hi> did aſſume the Government, without any Rule or Authority, and impoſe <hi>It</hi> and <hi>Themſelves</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:115669:18"/>upon the <hi>People,</hi> and ſo upon the <hi>Army;</hi> what Law is broken, in pulling down that which ſtands not by Law?</p>
            <p n="2">II. That Government, ſuch a Conſtitution as it had, was from the <hi>Army;</hi> the <hi>Army</hi> urg'd them to do juſtice upon the King, which they neither could nor durſt do themſelves: For, they and eveny Rational man muſt confeſs, that were it not for the Strength, Honor and Succeſs of the <hi>Army,</hi> that which we call <hi>Parliament, Government</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> would have been made <hi>Confederacy</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Army</hi> did at leaſt tolerate, and ſo far conſent, as to ſubmit to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I know not that they by any act did <hi>ratifie</hi> it, or ever intend to <hi>perpetuate</hi> it: And that conſent was not an act of Judgment and Righteouſneſs; for in all our Affairs hitherto <hi>we have not had ſo much light and clearneſs, as to produce any work of true Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> But as in all other things, ſo <hi>in this,</hi> we are driven and thruſt forward from one thing to that which is next, as the <hi>ſence of Danger</hi> and the <hi>hopes of Eaſe</hi> lead us, in the dark, without Judgment: And ſo the <hi>Army</hi> ſet up, or admit of this <hi>Government,</hi> by a <hi>Parliament,</hi> without <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> being at hand, knowing no better, finding ſome eaſe in being freed from worſe Oppreſſors, and as a preſent conveniency: And if they had power to <hi>admit it,</hi> or <hi>ſet it up,</hi> when they found it <hi>uſeful;</hi> why may they not <hi>pull it down</hi> and <hi>reject it,</hi> when they felt it <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That which you call the <hi>Government,</hi> as it never had a <hi>Formal Conſtitution</hi> either from God or men (that I know of) ſo before it was taken down, it had quite loſt the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Government;</hi> a dry Tree, ſhrunk up into a private and ſelfiſh ſpirit: There were good men and good things amongſt them; but as the Princes of <hi>Zoan,</hi> Iſa. 19. mingled with a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> &amp; <hi>fooliſh ſpirit,</hi> that four or five of the beſt of them could not agree in any <hi>one Propoſition</hi> for publick good; though they were both wiſe &amp; honeſt men, yet <hi>(they themſelves know)</hi> they were abſurdly and peeviſhly divided, in ſo great a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that there could be no reaſon of expecting any more fruit from them: They were a long while a <hi>Burthen</hi> to the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> very ſenſible of it; and did, by a general
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115669:19"/>diſlike and ſcorn of them, re-call that <hi>choice</hi> that they had made of them, and the Honor they had put upon them; and would, if the <hi>Army</hi> had not guarded them, have expreſs'd their rejecting of them from being <hi>their Repreſentatives,</hi> by pulling them out of the Houſe; they were indeed full ripe; and, had not the <hi>Army</hi> done it, the rage of Women, or ſome ſuch baſe hand would have gather<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">IV. The then General and Officers did not this work vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, which (for ought I know) they might have done, had they had light and ſtrength ſufficient for it; but they were thruſt upon it by the Soldiers and inferior Officers, which I ſuppoſe you may remember, and that your own ſpirit was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and active in it, and much rejoyc'd in it when it was done, and you had indeed ſome more reaſon for it than others, for <hi>that body</hi> was very averſe to your way, and to the things you would have done, yea far more averſe than this <hi>preſent Power</hi> is: For you now to fetch your Enemies (ſo you counted them while they liv'd) out of their Graves, to oppoſe and accuſe your Friends, for an act which you approv'd of, it is a <hi>ſtrange change</hi> of your mindes: If you could come out of this <hi>miſt</hi> of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> and behold your preſent poſture, how you ſeem to love, and plead for that which <hi>is not;</hi> which, if it were again, you would ſeek the deſtroying of it again; and how you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them with hatred, which did your work for you, and are your Friends, you would be <hi>greatly aſtoniſh'd</hi> at the ſtrange form of your own ſpirits (a greater wonder than <hi>Change of Governments</hi>) and you would <hi>confeſs,</hi> I am apt to <hi>believe,</hi> That both your <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and your <hi>Enmity</hi> to <hi>theſe,</hi> is feigned and not real.</p>

            <p>I muſt deal as nakedly as I can with you, and them, and all the world, and tell you, That I do think there was Iniquity in that action, and in all actions of that nature; for, <hi>pulling down</hi> is a dark and wrathful Miniſtry, and ordinarily perform'd by ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Jehu</hi> had, whoſe <hi>name</hi> ſhewed his <hi>nature, ſibi conſtans,</hi> conſtant to it ſelf, or ſelf-ſeeking, though imployed by God: To deſtroy old worldly buildings, though very <hi>rotten,</hi> is not a work for a pure Evangelical ſpirit; the Vengeance adminiſtred may be righteous, but if there were not a deal of fleſhly Zeal, Pride, Self love, and ſome bruitiſh Cruelty or hardineſs in us, we ſhould not be fit for ſuch a ſervice.

            <p>The next thing I would note to you is, You ſay, <hi>Juſtly ſuſpected ends in time paſt;</hi> and in your <hi>Paper, Not knowing the deep Policies of worldly States-men:</hi> You uſe to <hi>acknowledge God</hi> in all theſe things, and that this work was carryed on with <hi>a high hand of Providence,</hi> beyond all the contrivance of men: Sure you have chang'd your ſtation, you were <hi>within,</hi> and ſaw the <hi>inward</hi> Spring, <hi>Gods hand;</hi> now you are <hi>without,</hi> and look upon the <hi>outſide</hi> of the Hanging, and there you ſee <hi>Policy;</hi> our Judgments alter as our Sight, that which is a Man while we are nigh to it in Love, removed at a diſtance by a little Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeems to be a Beaſt: Love thinks no evil, ſees nothing but <hi>God in all;</hi> Enmity removes God from the ſight, and ſets up men and deep deſigns.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115669:20"/>ſo your mindes ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt:</hi> You were children once, and thought as ſimply and childiſhly as I do, That neither the Protector himſelf, nor the wiſeſt Heads amongſt them, have the tenth part of that foreſight that is required to lay ſuch a Deſign; I imagine they are as weak as you and I, and other people, that know not what will be too morrow, nor have they foreſeen the things that are come to paſs. Now pray how came you to be ſo wiſe, as to underſtand theſe <hi>Polititians?</hi> who taught you this? I fear 'twas the <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Accuſer;</hi> ſure theſe deep reaches do but torture and vex your mindes, therefore 'tis better to be children ſtill, and to look up to <hi>Gods hand</hi> in all things, be they good or evil: And if they are wiſe States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as I fear there is too much of it amongſt them (but not as you imagine) let us that are ſtanders by and overlook them, either pity them or laugh at them; for I am for either, ſo it be innocent and harmleſs.</p>
            <p>They have by their craft pull'd down the King and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſet up themſelves in their place; this is the plot: And by this have made their Enemies to hate them <hi>more</hi> than they did, and their Friends to hate them <hi>more</hi> than ever they hated the Cavaliers; which they cannot but expect, if they ſit down in the Kings ſtate; for who ſo odious, as a treacherous and apoſtate Brother! Thus for a little forc'd Honor, they lift up themſelves publick objects of Scorn and deſpite to both ſides: A fine policy.</p>
            <p>They may uſe their Policy, but God hath a Deſign upon them, which hath taken effect; they are brought in a ſnare, catched in a net of perplexities, where they are beſet with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Danger and Trouble on every ſide, and know not which way to go for Safety, they can neither go backwards nor forwards; <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Cavaliers</hi> preparing againſt them abroad, their <hi>old Enemies</hi> at home more and more inraged againſt them, their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> diſſerting and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them: If their worldly Policy hath brought them into this pit, I am confident, the more they <hi>deviſe,</hi> the <hi>deeper</hi> they will go into <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and that it muſt be Simplicity, Humility, and a <hi>childiſh Obedience</hi> to the Lord, that muſt bring them out.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115669:21"/>'Tis a fair warning to you, you are witneſſing, declaring, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, ingaging a party againſt theſe, as they againſt the King, you begin to underſtand the way of it; if you ſhould undermine them, as they have done others (which I think you will not do) you would, by getting the power and place, get the confuſion, perplexity and trouble they have; and that as much more, as your ſtrength or cunning will be greater than theirs.</p>

               </gap>ly, ſomething will ſtick: I had rather ſay to you, as our Lord to his Diſciples, when they were in ſuch a paſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. <hi>Ye know not what maner of Spirit ye are of;</hi> they thought 'twas nothing but Zeal for Chriſt, exercis'd in a way of God in Faith, and according to a good Scripture example, <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from Heaven, and conſume them, as Elias, did?</hi> But Chriſt diſowns this, though it ſeems to be high Religion, yet 'tis but the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> not of a <hi>Savior; The Son of Man is come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them:</hi> Let me onely deſire you to turn your mindes a little from your preſent Anger, and to <hi>conſider</hi> and <hi>anſwer</hi> theſe few <hi>Queſtions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether have you theſe things upon your own <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or upon, the <hi>report</hi> of others? Have all you that have ſubſcrib'd this Paper, heard the Protector <hi>Blaſpheme the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> and <hi>Reproach his People?</hi> &amp;c. Or have you ſeen <hi>His Pride, Luxury and Laſciviouſneſs?</hi> I may well ſuppoſe you have not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. You ſay this is <hi>your Teſtimony and Witneſs;</hi> Dare you, or can you be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of theſe things before any <hi>Iudge?</hi> You <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>publiſh</hi> them; but can any honeſt indifferent

               <hi>Iudge</hi> admit of you to be <hi>lawful Witneſſes</hi> in the things you have not <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>ſeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Conſider then, whether in this you act according to the <hi>loweſt line</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> according to the common Juſtice and Honeſty that is amongſt men? 'Tis a great <hi>abomination,</hi> though commonly practis'd amongſt <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> raſhly to receive and give credit to evil and falſe Reports of them they <hi>hate,</hi> or that are of an <hi>oppoſite party,</hi> and that too in a way of Religion; which if examin'd, will be judg'd, by the common Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be, not onely Ungodly, but Unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Whether do you think, that the <hi>great Iudge</hi> will judge according to that appearance, wherein you now behold the Protector and his actions? which is not ſo good as <hi>by the ſight of the Eye, and by the hearing of the Ear,</hi> but by others <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Whether, though you are now admitted to be <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> againſt the <hi>Protector,</hi> as innocent perſons, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your ſelves and your own party (it may be to none but your ſelves) yet when he and you (now two parties) ſhall ſtand before <hi>the impartial Tribunal of the great Iudge,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then you will be able to lift up your heads to <hi>accuſe him,</hi> and will not rather be found as guilty as he, and to ſtand in need of the ſame mercy with him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 6. 'Tis true, God will <hi>judge</hi> the <hi>Protector,</hi> for any raſh and unſeemly word or act, againſt any perſons or things that do but pretend to God; and for every motion and expreſſion of <hi>Pride, Falſhood,</hi> or <hi>vain Pleaſures:</hi> But do you not think that this <hi>Eye of God</hi> will pierce through this Miſt of <hi>Calumny</hi> that is upon him? Through this <hi>thick clay</hi> of worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with which he is now <hi>dawb'd over</hi> and oppreſs'd; and through the <hi>vail</hi> of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which makes him walk unevenly; and <hi>ſearch</hi> his Heart, whether it be Obedient and Upright, or true to God and his work, or falſe in it, and ſeek to ſet up himſelf? God will certainly <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>try</hi> him, the ſecret ſpirit of his minde, what <hi>it is</hi> in his work; and when he hath done that, do you not think he will ſearch deeper than his Spirit in his <hi>work,</hi> which may be weak and mixt, and at laſt <hi>judge</hi> him according to the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115669:22"/>and his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in him? And then let me ask you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will not ſo <hi>judge</hi> you? Look through your vail of Duties, Profeſſion and Ordinances; and <hi>try</hi> your <hi>Heart,</hi> with what Spirit of Love, Obedience and Truth you are in your <hi>work;</hi> and whether will you ſtand to this judgment? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God ſhould judge you according to Grace, to the Name and Nature of Chriſt, written upon you and in you? Sure the <hi>great Iudge</hi> will thus <hi>judge</hi> us at laſt, by his <hi>great judgment</hi> or <hi>laſt judgment,</hi> not by the outward <hi>Converſation</hi> nor inward <hi>Intention,</hi> but finally by his eternal Election, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>When you have conſider'd theſe Queſtions, let me deſire you to reade the thoughts of my heart concerning the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of your Charge; which thoughts are not upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Fact, but what account my Experience and Reaſon gives me of ſuch things: For if I do meet with ſuch Reports as theſe, as ſometimes I do, and ſwallow them down without trying of them, and do bring them out again in Diſcourſe; I finde they do pollute my ſoul, and that it is a very naughty Spirit that made me either Receive or Report them: But when I have the exerciſe of any kinde of Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, I finde cauſe to reject them; the grief that I have receiv'd by them, makes me more expert in trying of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Slighting and Blaſpheming the Spirit of God;</hi> I ſuppoſe ſome men bring to the <hi>Protector,</hi> things in the Name of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that he judges weak and fooliſh <hi>Fancies,</hi> thoſe he ſlights; others bring him things that he judges <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi> and that, as they think, from the Spirit, theſe he <hi>blaſphemes</hi> or <hi>ſpeaks evil</hi> of: And this he may do in Paſſion and fleſhly hardneſs, not in <hi>tenderneſs to him</hi> that utters them, who being grieved in his ſpirit, ſays <hi>the Spirit is ſlighted:</hi> There is <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy</hi> in one man againſt another, wherein both may pretend to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and this is too common: There is <hi>Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Son of Man;</hi> I know not that any amongſt us are guilty of this <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> becauſe I ſee none come forth in the power and purity of his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and if they do, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be forgiven them.</hi> But for <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the Spirit,</hi> in that ſence wherein Chriſt expreſſes it, I dare not think any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115669:22"/>man guilty of it, becauſe the Spirit it ſelf in his own majeſty doth not (to my ſence) appear, but vail'd with humane weaknes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reproaching and Impriſoning his people:</hi> We commonly call <hi>our ſelves</hi> and <hi>our party, Gods people;</hi> but that you are ſo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them, or that they are ſo, excluding you, no third party or perſon can admit: And for <hi>Reproaches,</hi> you are even with them if not beforehand; and, I doubt, would be in <hi>Impriſoning</hi> alſo, if you had power. The concluſion that I make is this, Some of Gods people may for their weakneſs deſerve, and others in their weakneſs may inflict, <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Impriſonment</hi> upon Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride, Luxury, Laſciviouſneſs:</hi> I ſuppoſe you intend onely his high living, though your words ſeem to charge his perſon with very foul abominations; I am no Courtier, and therefore know not what his Converſation is in private: But in the times of my acquaintance with him, I did not obſerve any ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in him; and in Reaſon, Age and multitude of Buſineſs, if not Vertue, ſhould keep him from ſuch Senſuality now: I have heard alſo ſome that have been his Servants, near to him, and <hi>ſtrict obſervers</hi> of him, report, That his frequent Praying Faſting and Watching, with other conſcientious and ſtrict Obſervances, ſhew'd him inclin'd rather to turn Quaker than to looſneſs.</p>
            <p>His <hi>way of living,</hi> I confeſs, I have ſometimes grudged at, as too <hi>Kingly,</hi> and not proportionable, either to his late condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or to the preſent condition of his Brethren; or to his own affairs, being in ſuch want of Money: But upon further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Cenſure, I do finde, that ſuch as you and I are, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at diſtance from ſuch Greatneſs, our <hi>Mindes</hi> and <hi>Breedings</hi> being as mean as our <hi>Conditions,</hi> and our Spirits <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,</hi> being <hi>outcaſts</hi> alſo from this preſent Glory, are troubled with a little Envie; and ſo not at all fit to judge of it.

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:115669:23"/>gives us a true accompt of ſuch mens conditions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eat them; and what good is there to the owners thereof, ſaving the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with their eyes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Changing of Principles:</hi> Your way of Writing, ſhews you as unable to judge or Principles as I am; our mindes are ſo ſhort and diſtemper'd by paſſion, that we cannot give a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accompt of the <hi>ſeries</hi> of Actions: If any croſs our wills and opinions, we are ſo much diſturb'd at the ſence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil done to us, that we cannot conſider the good that ſuch perſons <hi>have done,</hi> or <hi>now do</hi> for us; All former things are forgotten, and we are nothing but Anger, and think them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Miſchief or Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>And when we are inraged, we let fly at mens <hi>Principles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſatisfied to rebuke mens Actions, Opinions and Works, but would be aveng'd of their <hi>Principles</hi> too; as if we would kill them at <hi>very heart,</hi> pull them up by the <hi>roots,</hi> and leave them in an incurcable condition, <hi>Rotten</hi> in their <hi>Principles.</hi> Mens <hi>Actions</hi> are crooked and various, Mens <hi>Opinions</hi> or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, weak and uncertain; <hi>Affections</hi> change as the wind; yea we may ſee the Heart waver and ſtagger, ſometimes Evil, ſometimes Good carries it away: But how far goes Man in the trying of theſe things? Can <hi>he ſearch the Heart,</hi> to know what it is? But <hi>Principles</hi> lie deeper than the Heart, and are indeed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Begining</hi> of all things, who, though Heart fail, and Fleſh fail, yet he abides the root of all.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth conſidering, whether the Serpent may not, in directing the blindeneſs of Man to charge all the weakneſs of their Brethren upon <hi>Principles,</hi> intend to grieve and wound <hi>Chriſt himſelf:</hi> I do but propound it to conſider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this kinde of Uncharitableneſs is common, moſt men thinking they do'nt <hi>charge home,</hi> nor ſpeak to the purpoſe, if they do'nt reach mens <hi>Principles,</hi> which indeed are ſafe enough from all mens Enmity.

I'll tell you what I think, That you will repent of this buſineſs if you live, and that long before you ſhall come nigh the <hi>impartial Tribunal of God;</hi> and not onely repent of this Spirit, but of your great confidence in it. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth always;</hi> had you <hi>fear'd</hi> more, you would have been more happy: My Soul trembles at it, not daring to come, or to think that you ſhould come to the <hi>Altar,</hi> much leſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115669:24"/>to the <hi>impartial Tribunal of God;</hi> with ſuch a Spirit.</p>
            <p>There is much of this Trade abroad in the world, men make it their work to take up Reports againſt them they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to, and dreſs them up with Religion, Scripture, a ſhew of Zeal <hi>for God,</hi> and then cry them abroad, either in Pulpits or in private Diſcourſe, ordinarily mingled with either a bitter curſe, or a taunt and ſcorn: So that it is a very great part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion abroad, to defame their Adverſaries, and this with great pleaſure and a ſhew of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>I do deſire that you and others would ſeriouſly weigh theſe Conſiderations upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt not raiſe,</hi> or as in Marg. <hi>receive a falſe Report: Put not thine hand with the wicked, to be an unrighteous witneſs.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither ſhalt thou speak in a cauſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline after many to wreſt judgment.</hi> 3. <hi>Neither ſhalt thou coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a poor man in his cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conſider what Reports are; generally, They are the <hi>eccho</hi> or <hi>reflection</hi> that mens perſons and actions make upon <hi>Empty, Malicious</hi> and <hi>Proud</hi> mindes:</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Empty</hi> and hollow mindes make a Report or noiſe; The ſolid Chriſtian, <hi>his voice is not heard in the ſtreets,</hi> his work is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at home upon his own ſoul, and his <hi>converſation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> with the glorious works of Chriſt;: But the formal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is a <hi>Buſie body,</hi> exercis'd in the baſe and vile things of other mens iniquities, or in the <hi>Report</hi> of them, which are <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>impure</hi> things, like himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Reports are brought forth by <hi>Malice;</hi> did men love, they would <hi>cover iniquity: Charity thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.5, 6. If a man did either love God or his Brother, he would <hi>abominate evil,</hi> not take it into his <hi>thoughts,</hi> nor <hi>rejoyce</hi> to hear or ſpeak of <hi>iniquity,</hi> becauſe <hi>iniquity</hi> is an enemy both to God and to his Brother. But <hi>Malice,</hi> which is the <hi>height</hi> of ſin and wickedneſs, makes a man love ſin, and delight in it, becauſe it <hi>ſerves</hi> him to pull down them that he hates: So that he <hi>joyns</hi> himſelf to <hi>Sin,</hi> and is <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>federate</hi> with it, becauſe it doth miſchief to his Adverſaries; and therefore it is, that though he ſeem to <hi>dislike</hi> it, yet he gives it the advantage of his gifts, his Zeal and Language to inlarge and advance it.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115669:24"/>
            <p>Malice is a very baſe thing, but this kinde of malice is the worſt: A noble enemy truſts to the righteouſneſs, truth and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of his own Cauſe, and being ſatisfied with that, can wait with patience till <hi>God bring forth his righteouſneſs;</hi> but ſcorns to defile himſelf, by making uſe either of the ſins of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or the lying reports of the world, to help his Cauſe, or hurt his Enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Pride</hi> raiſes Reports; for were a ſoul truly ſenſible of his own and others miſerable captivity in this world, and under this body of death, he would not take pleaſure in ſpeaking of other mens <hi>evil actions,</hi> or the <hi>fame</hi> of them, but his ſoul would be bow'd down into ſecret mourning for the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>root</hi> of Sin and Death in himſelf and others.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed a <hi>cruel</hi> kinde of <hi>prido,</hi> either to make men ſinners if they are not, or to make them worſe than they are; or if they be indeed fallen, to trample upon them, and inſult over them by bitter and publique Accuſations; or for men to exalt their own <hi>ſeeming Religion and Righteouſneſs,</hi> by that which is an offence to God, and a wound to his name, and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We ſee what is the root of reports, whence they come: Let us conſider in the next place that the <hi>Text</hi> calls them <hi>falſe reports:</hi> They are <hi>generally</hi> ſo, they can't be <hi>true</hi> that are the children of ſuch parents, as Hypocriſie, Malice and Pride: Man is a lye, he is ſo <hi>vain</hi> a thing, that he can hardly be true in the <hi>beſt</hi> temper; he is a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> glaſs, that gives very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <hi>repreſentations</hi> of things: Put a ſtraight ſtick into the water, and it will ſeem crooked, eſpecially if the water be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the wind, ſo are the mindes of men naturally as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and at this time water agitated by ſeveral winds of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ions, Diſcontents, Jealouſies, Prejudices and Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo that 'tis impoſſible to meet with a right repreſentation of any man, or his actions in the world: All ſorts of men, good and bad, have been abuſed by reports, I have obſerv'd it from the beginning of theſe times, we never could have a juſt and true accompt of our Enemies, but <hi>very bad</hi> men have been made much worſe by <hi>reports;</hi> if I finde a man delighting to cenſure them he diſ-affects, though it be mingled with a <hi>demure</hi> look
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115669:25"/>and <hi>Scripture language,</hi> yet if it come onely as news, behinde mens backs, to ſtir up rage againſt their Enemies, I conclude 'tis falſe, either <hi>totally</hi> or in part, a thing not done, or not done with <hi>that minde</hi> as is reported, or in that <hi>maner:</hi> And if any will trouble himſelf to examine ſuch a report to the bottom, I do not doubt but he will finde it ſo; but for my part, if I finde him out of his way; in <hi>publike,</hi> when it ſhould be in private, and <hi>behinde</hi> the <hi>back,</hi> when it ſhould be to the perſons face; or if I finde him <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>biting,</hi> or <hi>idle jeering</hi> and <hi>quibling,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him a Vagabond, and count it more ſafe and eaſie to ſhut the door upon him; for if I do but give him <hi>a nights lodging,</hi> he leaves the ſting wherewith he wounded anothers name in my ſpirit, to my great pain; and this I often finde by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Therefore a third obſervation have I lean'd from the <hi>Text,</hi> and experience not <hi>to receive</hi> ſuch <hi>falſe reports;</hi> The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver</hi> is guilty as well as the <hi>Reporter: He that loveth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a lye,</hi> Rev.22.15. they are thruſt out together; for he that <hi>loves,</hi> entertains and rejoyces in <hi>a lye,</hi> is of the ſame nature with him that <hi>made</hi> it; 'tis no excuſe therefore, I heard it, and I heard it of many honeſt men: A lye is a baſe, void, foul thing, which a heart that <hi>loves truth</hi> may diſcern and reject, what ever tongue brings it; but hereby men are cheated, if a friend bring it, and it be againſt an Enemy, we think we ſhall do it wrong to queſtion or ſuſpect it, whereas we may juſtly ſuſpect every <hi>man; Man and Lye</hi> being ſo much allied: Parties are never free from malice, nor malice free from lyes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men had need take heed what they receive in theſe days.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Branch of this Obſervation is, By <hi>receiving</hi> men <hi>raiſe a falſe report,</hi> it may be from a diſturb'd paſſionate tongue into a more ſerious minde, and from common idle talk, into devout and religious Conſiderations, and from them into Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, into praying and preaching, and at laſt 'tis <hi>rais'd,</hi> as in this Letter, to the <hi>impartial Tribunal</hi> of God; ſo that which at firſt is either nothing or ſome humane frailty, it may be ſome raſh word or action from a temptation, is made a <hi>great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,</hi> for which the perſon and his way or work is condemn'd, and Religion, Scripture and the Name of God brought in to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115669:25"/>execute it: What follows in this Scripture, I would have the Subſcribers and all discontented people conſider, <hi>Put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witneſs.</hi> The ſame things that you in <hi>this Letter and Paper teſtifie</hi> againſt our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, the common people of the Nation which you judge <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> do exclaim againſt them: <hi>Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, deſtroying the Foundations of a Commonwealth, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down others to ſet up themſelves, Taxes upon pretence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;</hi> Theſe things are charged upon them by your and their Enemies; which if you had conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, you would not have <hi>put your hands</hi> to the <hi>Paper,</hi> neither will you any longer joyn with your <hi>wicked Enemies,</hi> to deſtroy your <hi>Friends.</hi> Verſe 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil, &amp;c.</hi> All forts of people almoſt are againſt the preſent Power, <hi>Cavaliers, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Levellers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> reproaches are ſo <hi>general,</hi> and come ſo <hi>thick,</hi> upon us in all places, that 'tis a kinde of a crime not to comply: A man can hardly keep the liberty of his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to think or hope well of the preſent Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>cenſure</hi> of being a <hi>Courtier:</hi> to diſlike Government is counted a vertue: 'Tis true, ſome of your Exceptions (and the weakeſt of them) are proper to you and your party, but the moſt and the ſtrongeſt are <hi>Vox populi:</hi> Therefore your witneſs doth either follow or lead a <hi>multitude to do evil;</hi> which, if it doth not <hi>condemn</hi> your Cauſe, it renders it <hi>foully ſuſpitious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſe 3. <hi>Neither ſhalt thou countenance a poor man in his cauſe.</hi> This diſcovers a ſubtile temptation which draws men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnare of injustice, while they ſeem to exerciſe mercy; there is a ſhew of righteouſneſs in Suffering, which is very attractive to poverty, and move the Affection, if not the Judgement to their Cauſe, be it right or wrong: Good men were lately low, and evil men high; people are apt to think 'tis ſo ſtill, and that Greatneſs is oppreſſion; and all ſuffering, righteouſneſs: I doubt many are ſeduced by this in theſe times, wherein there is ſo much of <hi>blind affection,</hi> and ſo little of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> 'Tis ſurely good to be caution'd againſt the <hi>confidence</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>multitude,</hi> and the <hi>inſinuations</hi> of the poor.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115669:26"/>
            <p>'Tis not amiſs to read and conſider what follows, <hi>If thou meet thine enemies ox or aſs going aſtray,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou ſee the aſs of him that hateth thee, lying under his burthen,</hi> &amp;c. Here you have not <hi>an ox or aſs going aſtray, and lying under a burthen,</hi> but men, your friends: The Text tells you your duty, if you be able to perform it,
'tis to <hi>bring back</hi> that which is <hi>gone aſtray,</hi> and to help that which lyeth under its burthen.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chief Things expreſs'd in your <hi>Letter,</hi> which (as I conceive) do offend your minde; ſome generals that run through both your <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Paper incloſed,</hi> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hereafter.

            </head>
            <p>IN this <hi>Paper</hi> there is a <hi>Preface</hi> to the Articles, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> themſelves: In the <hi>Preface</hi> you do as you do in your Letter, ſhew us your Commiſſion which yon have, <hi>after a long time, earneſt ſeeking of the Lord, what we finde in our conſciences:</hi> and afterward, <hi>in faithfulneſs towards God, and meekneſs towards men, perform what duty is incumbent upon us:</hi> and at laſt, <hi>in purſuance of our duty to God, our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, as Chriſtians, as men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In theſe things I ſuppoſe you put much confidence, and think that none that are religious will oppoſe a Work that comes into the field, in the name of <hi>Duty &amp; Conſcience,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. I deny not that theſe things <hi>are</hi> amongſt you, and in a great meaſure, but I would adviſe you not to build too much upon them, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, Becauſe, if you will look abroad, you cannot but ſee, what with great grief; of heart I have obſerv'd, That <hi>in</hi> and <hi>with</hi> theſe things, <hi>viz. The kingdom of Chriſt, Glory of God, much ſeeking of God, Conſcience, Duty,</hi> &amp;c. in ſome, where there ſeems to be as <hi>much purity, ſincerity</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs</hi> as in your ſelves, I may ſay, <hi>more light, evidence</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> yet I ſay ſuch vile things have come forth <hi>in them</hi> and <hi>with them,</hi> which you your ſelves would abhor, and which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that brought them forth have ſadly repented of; do but therefore allow of a little ſuſpition of your ſelves, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſome while they honeſtly and heartily (for ought either themſelves or others know) <hi>ſeek after Chriſt,</hi> they are led into unreaſonable and abſurd things, contrary to the light of Nature and Religion, and to the hurt of themſelves and mankinde; and why may not you in your religious <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> be carried into things contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115669:27"/>
               <hi>Love,</hi> and deſtructive to your ſelves and the publick peace.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, Becauſe you come forth, not againſt a people that are <hi>prophane,</hi> but ſuch as are exerciſed in the ſame things that you are, a people that <hi>pray;</hi> that <hi>wait</hi> and <hi>ſeek</hi> for God and his Light to guide them, as highly <hi>profeſſing</hi> and <hi>practiſing religious Duties</hi> as your ſelves, and are in that wherein you oppoſe them in their <hi>duty to God and men,</hi> and for ought that you or I can judge, with as much <hi>ſincerity</hi> as you, and ſuch as have ſhined in the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>godlineſs equal</hi> to you, if not <hi>beyond</hi> you, ſo that 'tis but <hi>praying</hi> againſt <hi>praying, duty</hi> againſt <hi>duty, conſcience</hi> againſt <hi>conſcience,</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> againſt <hi>ſincerity;</hi> therefore if you do indeed honor theſe things as part of the Grace and Kingdom of Chriſt, conſider you do with Chriſt oppoſe Chriſt, you ſight againſt your own <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſtrength:</hi> Is it not then far more honorable and Chriſtian-like, to ſuffer the greateſt loſs of worldly <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> and to pay <hi>Taxes, Tithes</hi> and all that can be laid upon us, or that you contend againſt, rather than to war <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt, duty</hi> againſt <hi>duty, prayer</hi> againſt <hi>prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, Becauſe this Quarrel hath been fought alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>conſicience to God,</hi> with <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>ſeeking of the Lord,</hi> in defence of <hi>the kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and his Way and Worſhip, againſt a people who in obedience to their King, maintain'd the <hi>Legal Rights</hi> and <hi>cuſtomary Worſhip</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and judgement given in the caſe, not onely <hi>for you,</hi> but for all the <hi>honeſt people</hi> of the Nation which ingaged for this <hi>cauſe;</hi> they therefore that will not reſt in the ſentence of God, but make another Quarrel about the ſame thing (wherein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is none) will I think ſuffer as contentions in a high degree; ſetting the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> againſt the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> 'tis therefore but reaſon that <hi>good men</hi> and <hi>good things</hi> ſhould now live peaceably together, or if there be a difference, that we do not arm our ſelves as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly-religious againſt the outwardly prophane; not with <hi>Declarations, Accuſations,</hi> nor with outward <hi>weapons,</hi> no nor with <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> in <hi>enmity,</hi> and againſt one another, as formely we did againſt the Cavaliers; but with the ſpirit
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115669:27"/>of God, which is a <hi>ſpirit of love</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> with more inward weapons that will pierce to the <hi>dividing of ſoul and ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, Becauſe the things that you <hi>profeſs,</hi> and that we have <hi>ſpoken</hi> of, had their time and their work in <hi>publick,</hi> in which they appear'd in <hi>power</hi> and <hi>majeſty</hi> againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but alas how much are they now <hi>polluted</hi> with folly, madneſs, groſs error, vanity, wrath and violence, as if the <hi>Abomination of Deſolation</hi> were in the <hi>holy place!</hi> 'Tis too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in others, and viſible enough in your <hi>Paper,</hi> where there is (it grieves me to ſay it) falſhood, wrath, deceit, and blowing the fire of War amongſt brethren, which is <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>gracious ſpirits,</hi> yea, to <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> and tends directly to lay us <hi>deſolate,</hi> without ſafety or protection; therefore what ever you think of the <hi>glory</hi> of your <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as you have dreſt it up, I muſt in faithfulneſs tell you my ſenſe of it, (which I believe will be the ſenſe of all rational men) I had rather ingage for the <hi>honeſt principles</hi> of Neceſſity, Safety, publick Peace, civil Government, though under many defects and corruptions, than for the <hi>higheſt things</hi> that you profeſs, ſo as you now profeſs them; and though this may appear to you prophane, yet I know there is nothing more prophane nor more likely to extirpate all <hi>Religion,</hi> and to ſet <hi>Atheiſm</hi> on the throne, than for honeſt and religious people to <hi>war</hi> upon one another.</p>
            <p>Therefore Friends, before you go any further, be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to come forth of that <hi>private ſpirit</hi> in which you are, and with a little charity look abroad, and you will finde the Sun doth not ſhine onely into your window: That the <hi>law of God is wondrous broad,</hi> and ſpreads it ſelf over, and into other mens conſciences as well as yours, though with ſome <hi>difference,</hi> as the ſubject is <hi>diſpos'd</hi> to receive it; and that others are as true and obedient to <hi>that word</hi> which is <hi>differently diſpenc'd</hi> to them, as you are to what is manifeſt to you; and you cannot but in reaſon conclude, that thoſe that you oppoſe are bound in duty to God and man, to keep the peace againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers whatſoever: and if you are not ſunk into, and cover'd over with your own Religion as ſome are, their ſpirits being inferior to the Religion they profeſs, and ſo are maſter'd by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115669:28"/>it, and not ſuffered to behold any thing but the glory of it, if it be not ſo with you, you may ſee the ſame things in which you now come forth, in thoſe you oppoſe, and that <hi>own'd</hi> and <hi>teſtified</hi> to by <hi>Gods providence,</hi> in giving them a <hi>compleat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> over their enemies; there the ſame things that you now plead, have after long-ſufferings and ſore trials, attain'd more than we lookt for, and indeed as much as the world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>power to ſecure it:</hi> why then ſhould not you rather, quietly enjoy and improve together that <hi>great Mercy</hi> obtain'd by your and their <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>earneſt ſeeking of God,</hi> rather than begin a new and ſtrange Contention 'twixt <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>prayer, zeal</hi> and <hi>zeal;</hi> for this ſtrife, if it ſhould go on, would be moſt black and unchriſtian, and doth threaten the utter defacing of the honor Religion hath gotten in the earth, a miſerable overthrowing of that <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> we have, and the rooting out of Religion it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, Having ſhew'd us your Commiſſion, from <hi>Conſcience, Duty and Faithfulneſs to God,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115669:29"/>which you likewiſe would have upheld, though you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like their way and maner of doing it; but be perſwaded to conſider where you are, and what you have done; you have blown up a deadly enmity 'twixt your ſelves and your friends meerly upon outward circumſtances, or a falſe figure and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of difference: 'Tis a fire that burns fiercely, and ſeems to be implacable, but the fewel of it is very ſlight matter, or rather immaterial ſpeculations: when I conſider how much you are one, and how little you differ, how ſtrongly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily you are bound up in one Life, Religion and Safety, and how airy and childiſh your ſtrife is; You will excuſe me, if I be a little merry with your notional quarrel, theſe miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fancies may put you into a fret, make you <hi>ſcold</hi> a little, but I hope there will be never a <hi>broken pate</hi> in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis not at all a natural but a made and forc'd buſineſs, there being no material ground of a quarrel, therefore though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and trouble put you upon it raſhly, yet me thinks you ſhould not run ſo much hazard, with ſo much labor and pains to maintain a meer notion and ſhadow of difference; if they againſt whom you appear have but a <hi>little patience,</hi> and do nothing againſt you, you muſt needs be weary of the quarrel and the cauſe quickly: finding the foundation of the buſineſs ſo inconſiderable, I am almoſt inclin'd to leave it off; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though it be little in it ſelf, yet 'tis much to you, &amp; you ſeem to be ſerious in it, I ſhall endeavor what I can, to give you a better underſtanding of them and your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe this particular that we are upon, <hi>viz.</hi> That our preſent Governors are in the place of, and Succeſſors to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>his party,</hi> and that you and other unſatisfied people are in the place of, or are the <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>godly party,</hi> I ſhall take a little pains to ſhew the falacy of this conceit, which doth abuſe many.</p>
            <p>To clear this, let us ſearch for, if we can finde it, what was the real difference 'twixt the <hi>Cavalier</hi> and the <hi>Puritan,</hi> and ſo what was the root of the Quarrel 'twixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and then ſee whether the ſame Quarrel be carried on
'twixt the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> and our preſent <hi>Governors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this controverſie 'twixt the Religious and the Royal
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115669:30"/>party, there was firſt an inward Cauſe or Root of Diviſion; and ſecondly there were many Diſputes and Queſtions, which were the effects of that Diviſion: The firſt was leſs obſerv'd, but more effectual; the ſecond made a greater noiſe, more outward, as if the Quarrel had been onely about theſe things which were indeed but the effects of diviſion of hearts.</p>
            <p>Theſe outward things about which the <hi>Parliament</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary people were exercis'd, were the Prerogative of the <hi>King,</hi> and Priviledges of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, the power of raiſing <hi>Money, Monopolies, Ship-money, &amp;c.</hi> the power of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and in ſum, where the <hi>Supream Power</hi> was, whether in the <hi>King</hi> as Head, or in the <hi>Parliament</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the People, the Body? concerning theſe things you may obſerve:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, They were but the outſide of the Quarrel, wherein the more worldly mindes were exerciſed, and very remote from the inward Spring of difference which lay deeper, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, In theſe things (if I do not much miſtake) the King had the better Cauſe, more juſtified by the <hi>ancient Laws</hi> of the Land, for though he had been guilty of ſome <hi>mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-adminiſtration</hi> of Government, yet he offered very large ſatisfaction; neither were the Errors of his Government of ſo a high a nature, as to deſerve to be proſecuted by ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a war, to Depoſing and Death: Some Princes I believe have done the ſame or worſe things in Government, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtion'd for them; but there was more at the bottom: and it may be obſerv'd, that while the war was in the hands of men who onely minded theſe outward things, the King proſper'd exceedingly, and roſe from a very low condition to have far the greateſt power; for thoſe men that contended for worldly power, did <hi>luſt</hi> after, and unjuſtly challenge from the <hi>King</hi> thoſe Royal Prerogatives that our Laws had long given to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and for their luſting fell in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, Theſe outward things of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Priviledge,</hi> being but the clothing of the Work, are worn out, and we are for the preſent (in ſuch reſpects) in a worſe condition than
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115669:30"/>formerly, Power more <hi>arbitrary, Taxes</hi> more heavy, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of <hi>Parliament</hi> more violated, <hi>Laws</hi> of leſs authority; and if we could have fore-ſeen what effects War and change of Government would procure, we might in reaſon expect it; therefore they whoſe ſpirits are ingaged in theſe outward and worldly <hi>priviledges</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> onely or moſtly, have a very hard bargain of it, and muſt needs be very much offended, if their hearts do not value Religion, and the Liberties of it at a high rate, and have a charitable opinion of it, that it will when it may attain ſome quiet and ſecurity, bring forth the peoples <hi>liberties</hi> in more righteouſneſs and largeneſs than they have yet appear'd in.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations premis'd concerning the outward part of the Quarrel 'twixt the two parties, let us now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where the <hi>Original Diviſion</hi> lay, and whence it was that their ſpirits ſtood at ſuch a diſtance one from another.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, The honeſt or <hi>religious party,</hi> were by a <hi>work of God</hi> upon them, changed in their mindes, and were <hi>born</hi> into another <hi>ſpirit</hi> by the word of God, converting and turning their hearts by Repentance and Faith towards God: this life coming from God, depended upon him, ſubjected it ſelf to him, would be ruled by him, and not by man; the other <hi>party</hi> had no knowledge of this life, but hated it, ſcorn'd it, dealt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly with it, would not ſuffer this childe to breathe its own breath in prayer, nor to ſpeak its own language in preaching, nor to eat its own food, or alow it its own growth; as inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely cruel to it, as <hi>Egypt</hi> was to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being ſtrangely jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of it, as if it was the <hi>heir,</hi> and would in time get power to call them to accompt for all their wickedneſs, they did bend the ſtrength of the Government againſt it, and not onely ſo, but deviſed new ſtratagems to ſuppreſs it: We will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute whether this life of godlineſs was in <hi>fleſh</hi> or in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> 'twas doubtleſs much in <hi>fleſh,</hi> but not without <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but it was real, and ſuch as did denominate us to be the <hi>people and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> to be the <hi>ſeed of Iſrael,</hi> as the <hi>enmity</hi> of the other <hi>party</hi> denominated them to be <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to be of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> ſo that here were two <hi>kindes</hi> of ſpirit or mindes, one of <hi>God,</hi> another <hi>of the world,</hi> one ſeeming to ſpring from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115669:31"/>the old ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> the other ſeeming to ſpring out of the world, out of the earth: and the firſt took in all the <hi>godly party,</hi> hardly a man left out, the other took in the chief of men <hi>maliciouſly</hi> bent againſt <hi>godlineſs:</hi> Now if you my friends, that have ſubſcribed this Paper, will but reflect upon your ſelves, and look with the ſame eye upon your brethren, you cannot think that there is in your ſelves a <hi>work</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>godlineſs,</hi> that is not in them you oppoſe, or that there is in them any ſuch hatred to that <hi>grace of God,</hi> as was in the <hi>Kings party;</hi> but you muſt conclude, that though they are <hi>a bone ſtarted aſide</hi> one way, you <hi>a bone ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſide</hi> another way, yet you are members of the ſame body.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, As theſe two <hi>parties,</hi> the Religious and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>party</hi> differ'd in the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>kinde</hi> of their ſpirits, ſo did they in the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of their ſpirits; the one were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Law in the worſhip of God, and did ſee that he had given them Laws in his Word, far differing from thoſe which were practis'd and commanded in the Nation, the other did ſtiffly adhere to the <hi>Religion</hi> of their <hi>fore-fathers</hi> as it was <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> by <hi>law,</hi> and would not admit of any other, but cruelly perſecuted it, denying men to offer to God ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices as he required of them, and which they judged their duty to ſerve him in; now pray conſider, whether the caſe be ſo now 'twixt you and your brethren whom you oppoſe, whether are you denied to perform any duty of worſhip to God, that his word leads you to? nay, do not they do the ſame things with you? or do you bring forth any <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Religion that they oppoſe; for civil things and Government, I think you don't pretend to any <hi>law</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>notions</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of your ſpirits may in ſome circumſtantial things claſh, but you agree in your <hi>rule</hi> as to Religion, and to follow the ſame <hi>law</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all things, ſo far as it is reveal'd to you and them: freedom for your Conſciences to ſerve the Lord in as much holineſs and purity as you can, you have as much as you can deſire; if there bea deviation from the <hi>rule</hi> in civil things,
'tis not in <hi>enmity</hi> to any rule, no law of that nature coming forth that pretends to be from God.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:115669:31"/>
            <p>It may be of good uſe both for you the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> and for the <hi>Protector</hi> and our <hi>Governors,</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider the inward <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>root</hi> of difference 'twixt <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>enemies,</hi> and by it we may know where the marrow and ſtrength of our cauſe lies: 'Tis true, theſe things of <hi>godlineſs</hi> wrought in the heart, and <hi>conſcientious</hi> following the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did not at firſt appear openly in <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and accordingly they thrived, but when they whoſe hearts were ingaged in theſe things came into action, and the King had to do <hi>nakedly</hi> with ſuch ſpirits, he fell before them, and was trampled under foot as dirt; and it muſt needs be ſo, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have the leaſt ſtamp or mark of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>work</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> upon them, and ingaged to ſerve him, cannot but with its weight and authority preſs down the fleſhly arm and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man as nothing: I would propound it as a caution to both ſides:</p>
            <p>Firſt to our <hi>Governors,</hi> that they will in all their affairs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the motion and growth of <hi>this ſpirit of godlineſs,</hi> and not to ingage in Deſigns upon principles of worldly policy, be they never ſo ſpecious, but rather to ſit ſtill, and to attend the cheriſhing and increaſing of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>godlineſs,</hi> than to move in publick actions till this <hi>life</hi> leads them forth; and then, not out of prejudice or offence at the weakneſs and ſcruples of <hi>godly men</hi> to lay them aſide, and to commit their buſineſs to worldly men, though never ſo wiſe and gallant men, but to lay the ſtreſs of all affairs upon this <hi>spirit,</hi> which is doubtleſs the ſteddieſt and trueſt to the works of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly to the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> I would deſire you to keep cloſe to the firſt principles of <hi>real inward godlineſs,</hi> and that you ſink your ſpirits more into Fundamentals, and not to ſuffer your mindes to be elevated into high ſtrains, forms and notions of things, nor to be carried away with thoſe who never travel'd in the way of <hi>godlineſs,</hi> and are either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or unmindeful of the <hi>Power</hi> and ſubſtance of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is your danger in your preſent buſineſs; for many ſuch we have that flutter about, and talk of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his kingdom,</hi> that never were ſeaſon'd with the principles of <hi>true</hi> Religion, and are <hi>clouds without rain, wells without water;</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115669:32"/>and while they profeſs for an outward and glorious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, oppoſe and quarrel with the truth of godlineſs, and tall of outward freedom, while they are ſervants to Pride, Paſſion, Envy and ſuch like corruptions.</p>
            <p>But upon a little more ſearching into the inward nature of things, you will finde your Quarrel very ill bottom'd upon the former War; for you and your brethren whom you now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are as much one in the <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of your <hi>ſpirits,</hi> as ever you and they differ'd from the <hi>Cavalier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let rue deſire you to compare our preſent <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> in their ſtanding and actings with the <hi>old royal party,</hi> and you will ſee a great diſſimilitude 'twixt them; and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>your ſelves,</hi> in your preſent actings with the <hi>honeſt old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan party</hi> in their motions towards the War, and you will finde as wide a difference.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Thoſe of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>party</hi> grew out of an old ſtock and root of Worldly Greatneſs, where they had continued many Ages, unmoveably fixed in a State of outward pomp, far above, and oppoſite to the life and light of Religion, where being ſettled in Peace and Power, they had many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offers of the Light of Reformation, but they <hi>would not be healed;</hi> but being rich, and living at eaſe and pleaſure, were haughty, ſcorn'd all reproof being lifted up upon the <hi>higheſt glory</hi> of the world, were beyond the reach of the <hi>inſtruction</hi> of the poor people, who knew the truth, and ſo were <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> againſt the <hi>Light,</hi> bending all the force of Government againſt that Light that did ſpring forth; ſo that godly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo far from any hopes of doing any good upon them, that they might not live in the Nation without defiling their Conſciences, but were forced to fly into <hi>all parts</hi> of the world for a being; now if theſe poor people being thus provoked by the brutiſh and un-natural cruelty of the State, denying their innocent and peaceable ſpirits, the common freedom of nature, of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> if they did <hi>when they were call'd forth to it,</hi> riſe up againſt them, how juſtifiable it was?</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, you know the original of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Governors,</hi> that they are of late ſprung from a low and mean condition wherein they ſerv'd the Lord, and came forth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115669:32"/>with your ſelves from the ſame bondage, through the ſame dangers, by the ſame zeal, courage, praying, faſting, &amp;c. They never yet attain'd any ſettled and quiet State of <hi>Government,</hi> but are ſtill ſtrugling for life, and in perpetual danger of being over-turn'd by the malice of their and your enemies, who are ſtill laboring by ſecret plots, to do what they could not by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force: They are very far from eaſe and pleaſure, their work being full of difficulty, and mens mindes and tongues bent againſt them: A perſecuted people, malign'd, envied, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, puſh'd and lifted at by all ſorts of people at home and abroad, under the ſcourge of evil tongues, under the rod of dangers and fears, ſo cloſely follow'd with the croſs, that they have not <hi>opportunity</hi> to do <hi>good,</hi> nor to harden in <hi>evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They have gone as far as they have light to go, and profeſs they wait for more light; they ſeem to have an ear open to inſtruction, and not onely to give acceſs to their brethren to counſel them, but to invite them to it: And if they were not of themſelves diſpos'd to hearken to the voice of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> yet the miſerable uneaſineſs, unſafety, and trouble of their way, ſhould (me thinks) incline them to receive any rational Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals: Its poſſible there is more <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the Nation than is yet amongſt them, and they may be guilty of not ſeeking it out, but I (that have been a looker on) have not obſerv'd any <hi>wiſdom</hi> come forth in publick, that I could judge worthy to be a guide to them: And whereas the former Powers did deſign againſt the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of your ſelves and other honeſt men; theſe do conſcientiouſly, and I believe in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, ſtudy your and others <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>liberty;</hi> Now conſidering they are brethren of the ſame root with your ſelves, their toyl and labor, their difficulties, dangers and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their ſufferings and reproaches for performing their <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> in preſerving your <hi>liberties,</hi> it appears to me to be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, unnatural, and ingrateful for you to riſe up againſt them, uncal'd forth, as 'twas juſt and natural for us (being <hi>cal'd</hi> forth to it) to appear againſt the King and his party.</p>
            <p>Let me now repreſent to you the ſpirit of the <hi>old honeſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> if you duly conſider it, it had much <hi>worth</hi> in it; ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from many great and long-ſufferings, bonds, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115669:33"/>ſhame, death, perſecutions of all ſorts, which he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with much meekneſs and long-ſuffering, never attempting any thing againſt the <hi>Government,</hi> but pray'd for it honeſtly, labor'd to preſerve it: the ſufferings of that <hi>party</hi> for many years at home and abroad, did amount to a very great ſum, yet they never ſtir'd till they were call'd forth by the great <hi>Council of the Nation,</hi> a viſible Power; and then how ſolid, ſober, obedient and peaceable they were in their motion, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully praying for their enemies, and ſeeking not their <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> but their <hi>repentance,</hi> aiming at nothing of Power to themſelves, onely <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> in ſerving the Lord; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to this <hi>preſent ſtate</hi> of things blindlyand ſimply, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the ruine of the King and his Power, but urged to it by <hi>neceſsity</hi> for their <hi>ſafety;</hi> for they did ſhew a willingneſs to comply with the <hi>King,</hi> and to ſave him, but could not finde him in the leaſt <hi>natural</hi> to them, but all his Treaties and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions were not voluntary but forc'd, which was ſufficiently manifeſt; And then he would in time, and as he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, have return'd to his own <hi>natural</hi> courſe with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than before, which would have made the latter end to that poor people far worſe than the beginning; ſo far as this was naked and ſimple, it will juſtifie that <hi>party,</hi> and the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and peaceableneſs of their ſpirits, that they ſought the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their enemies to the laſt.</p>
            <p>But how different from this <hi>Copy</hi> are you in your preſent actings? your riſe is not from <hi>ſufferings,</hi> but from <hi>ſucceſs</hi> and heights of Confidence, being fleſh'd with victory, not having a deep ſpring of ſimplicity and obedience, but a deſign laid upon outward obſervation of the Advantages of War, and having place and Greatneſs in your eye if you prevail, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly your motions are raſh, heady, fiery, fierce, I may ſay, ſeeking War and Blood, and directly aiming at the <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of your brethren: therefore bear with me for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, you will, it may be, thank me hereafter: I muſt tell you what I really think, you come not near your pattern; for that ſpirit whoſe place you contend for was, though low and dark, yet ſolid, true, juſt, advancing from a great depth; after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; in ſtrength and integrity, and ſo endured much, waiting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115669:33"/>for its ſeaſon to come forth, and then attain'd more than in ever expected or ſought for; but yours in your <hi>preſent motion,</hi> which I believe is not <hi>yours</hi> neither, but a <hi>ſtrange ſpirit</hi> of diſcontent, is flaſhy, ſlight, full of rage, and may, as ſmoke, offend and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but will quickly vaniſh.</p>
            <p>This is one of the chief Grounds of the Quarrel begun, and therefore I have taken the more pains to examine it; I hope when you and others finde it a deceitful Ground, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from it, and not engage upon ſuch <hi>falſe</hi> ſhadows of things againſt <hi>true</hi> friends.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more that doth offend you, and 'tis hinted here and there in your Paper, That the preſent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranſactions have, been <hi>covenanted and proteſted againſt:</hi> You urge the <hi>Engagement and Acts of Parliament made againſt Monarchy,</hi> and particularly quote the words of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Officers and Soldiers of the Engliſh Army, <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. 1650. page 11, 12. <hi>We are perſwaded in our conſciences, that the late King and his Monarchy was one of the ten horns of the beaſt, ſpoken of</hi> Rev. 17.13, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I know not well how to help you over this block: 'tis ſad to me, to think how we have trifled with <hi>Oaths</hi> all along, ſwearing <hi>for</hi> every thing, and almoſt <hi>againſt</hi> every thing in the Nation; covenanting for King, and engaging directly againſt him: If the <hi>Land</hi> do not <hi>mourn,</hi> I wiſh it did in <hi>true repentance</hi> for theſe things, and that we did earneſtly ſeek unto the Lord for a way out of the <hi>bonds</hi> that are upon our necks by ſinful and raſh <hi>Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the interim, I cannot ſee that you do juſtly urge theſe things againſt your brethren:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe our great evil in this thing, is; we have ſworn raſhly, not in Righteouſneſs and Judgement, but in a heat and fit upon politick grounds for worldly advantages: 'twas a ſin to <hi>make</hi> them, &amp; 'tis a ſin to <hi>break</hi> them, which is greateſt I wil not determine; bur this I am ſure of, that you and all of us are guilty, and therefore 'tis not ingenuous to charge another for that which we are guilty of, without accuſing our ſelves alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, We may be aſham'd to remember any of them, but if one, why not all? why not the Covenant, Proteſtations,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115669:34"/>and at laſt the Oath of Allegiance? for in all, the name of God was called upon: There is an oath for the King and his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an Engagement and Declaration againſt him: 'twill be of little uſe to enquire, whether an Oath required by a ſettled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and voluntarily ſworn to, for an Ordinance of God, inſtituted in plain Scriptures both of old and new Teſtament (for ſo Kingly Government is) I ſay, whether ſuch an Oath? Or an Engagement injoyn'd by a broken Power, or a Declaration of an Army, that never challenged any lawful Power, againſt an inſtitution, upon an interpretation of a dark propheſie of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> whether of theſe two be moſt binding? 'Twill help you and us little to reſolve it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, This is moſt conſiderable how far the letter of Oaths binde? which may be in ſome doubtful, in others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory; and how far the equity and ſpirit of them binde? and then to enquire what is the pith and ſubſtance of all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and Covenants? which when ſifted out, let them have their juſt and righteous conſideration: And then 'twere good to conſider which of them this preſent Government be againſt, whether it be not againſt thoſe Oaths and Covenants made for the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>King;</hi> and if ſo, how came we to be acquitted from thoſe former <hi>Oathes?</hi> or whether it be againſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements</hi> made againſt <hi>Monarchy?</hi> it ſeems to me to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing ſet up beſides, rather than againſt that Engagement, being of another <hi>nature</hi> from that which we engaged againſt, as we ſhall ſee hereafter; But alas, theſe Queſtions do not heal nor help us, onely they may ſerve as duſt to put in our mouthes to ſilence us, that we upbraid not, nor accuſe one another.</p>
            <p>We have taken notice of the chief things in the Preface of your <hi>Paper,</hi> we ſhall now proceed to conſider the Articles of Accuſation themſelves, which ſpeak out plainly what it is that troubles you.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:115669:34"/>
            <p>YOur firſt Witneſs or Article is againſt Apoſtaſie, which you expreſs in a <hi>Parallel</hi> 'twixt <hi>this Nation</hi> and <hi>the old Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> in their <hi>deliverance out of Egypt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They and we have ſoon forgot God our Savior,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We have not ſet our hearts right,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but have gone back and deals treacherouſly, and turn'd aſide like a deceitful bowe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have provoked the Lord to anger by our inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This firſt is more honeſt and ingenuous than any thing that follows it; There is a ſerious truth in it, and 'tis ſoberly and humbly expreſt, if you do indeed mean what you have written; For you ſay, WE <hi>have ſoon forgo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ten God,</hi> &amp;c. WE <hi>have not,</hi> &amp;c. If you are true in this WE, you have taken your ſhare of the guilt and ſhame with your brethren, and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have own'd a union with them in this head ſin or root-ſin of Back ſliding, which is but juſt; if it was a ſlip, 'twas an honeſt and a loving one, be perſwaded to own it, and to <hi>number</hi> your ſelves with us ſinners, and to bear your part of guilt and puniſhment alſo if it comes: Sin is general, ſo will Judgement be, 'tis therefore ſafer for you to lie down under Self-condemnation, and either truſt to mercy, or ſeek to avert calamity, than to juſtifie your ſelves as innocent perſons and <hi>witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take no pleaſure in ſpeaking of it, but I fear what you write is too true, that there is a general Apoſtaſie amongſt us; it may be they that are in great place, and ſo liable to great temptations, are more guilty than others, or elſe their guilt is more manifeſt; but ſure there is a general declining in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Profeſſors of Religion,</hi> and, as you ſay, <hi>Our hearts have not been right, nor our ſpirits ſtedfaſt to God, but we have turn'd aſide like a deceitful bowe:</hi> 'Tis moſt manifeſt in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, We are in Religion divided into ſeveral opinions, forms, names, words and ways of worshipping God, in which we walk in enmity to our brethren of different judgements, which ſhews we have <hi>turn'd aſide</hi> from God, who <hi>is one,</hi> and his <hi>name one,</hi> whoſe <hi>Law is exceeding large,</hi> who <hi>is love:</hi> he <hi>ſaves all,</hi> comprehends <hi>all</hi> under <hi>his wings:</hi> And that which is purely of God and his word, 'tis ſweet, eaſie and delightful to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115669:35"/>all that are <hi>godly;</hi> but that which leads men into divided paths, and into oppoſition, whereby we grieve, afflict and offend <hi>godly ones,</hi> there is in all thoſe things ſome <hi>inventions</hi> of our own, ſomething of carnal reaſon: Therefore in all diviſions that are amongſt us, how ever we commend our own way as <hi>pure,</hi> and would impoſe it upon others, and not admit him to a ſhare of the <hi>ſalvation</hi> that God hath wrought for <hi>all his people</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, yet there is in every one mixtures of our own, which while we zealouſly proſecute, we <hi>turn aſide</hi> from God, and his law of Love.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, We do as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> abound in performances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes, in <hi>new moons, ſolemn aſſemblies,</hi> where we offer <hi>rivers of oyl,</hi> the <hi>beaſts of a thouſand mountains,</hi> expreſſions, enlargements, notions, ſcriptures, duties; yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> departed from God, and <hi>turn'd aſide</hi> into <hi>themſelves</hi> in theſe things: therefore are they call'd theirs <hi>own ways,</hi> and not that which God <hi>delighted in,</hi> Iſa. 66.3, 4. Alas, how groſly are our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, prayings, aſſemblings, churchings, polluted with pride, vain glory, worldly ends? is it not apparent that we <hi>deal treacherouſly</hi> with God, while we ſeem to exalt <hi>his kingdom,</hi> we do indeed ſeek our own <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>advantage,</hi> and the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our own gifts, party and miniſtery? For when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the ſtrength and might of our hearts in theſe things, and neglect to ſerve the Lord with our ſouls, in a ſoul humbling and ſoul-cleanſing work, wherein the <hi>power of godlineſe</hi> lies; and when by theſe things we life up our ſelves above others, and as Lords over others, do we not as <hi>a deceitful bowe?</hi> while we ſeem to ſhoot at <hi>Gods enemy,</hi> we ſhoot at our <hi>own enemies,</hi> and while we ſeem to aim at his honor, aim at our own.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, We once were meek and lowly, contented with mean things in the world, ſo we might but enjoy Chriſt in his own Ordinances; Now how we imploy our Gifts, our Light, our Zeal, our Way, to get uppermoſt, <hi>Diotrephes</hi>-like, to have the <hi>preeminence:</hi> what contending for dominion, envying, plotting, laboring either to maintain or got Greatneſs and Power? imploying our light and gifts to pull down and deſtroy, not to ſave, and that which would deſtroy, would riſe it ſelf and get into place: If there be amongſt us theſe three, or any
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115669:35"/>of them, there is departing from God; <hi>enmity, ſelf</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> the conſtant companions of Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>If we have departed from God, and the majeſty and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſalvation, into deſtroying enmity, into perverſe ſelf, into tyrannical pride, 'tis no wonder you complain that 'tis a day of <hi>rebuke, of trouble and blaſphemy:</hi> And what kinde of <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> not from <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> ſent from the <hi>King of Aſſyria,</hi> but from <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>miniſters</hi> which ſay they are ſent from <hi>God,</hi> and ſhould bring tidings of peace? this muſt needs be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi> both to them that adminiſter it, and to them againſt whom 'tis adminiſtred; it muſt needs be pitiful and ſad work to <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme</hi> or ſpeak evil of our brethren that profeſs the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> when every word wounds our <hi>friends,</hi> and the <hi>Name of God,</hi> it muſt alſo wound our <hi>ſelves:</hi> when if what we ſay be true, 'tis woful: and ſad, when the beſt of it is, that what is ſaid is falſe, and a miſtaken paſſion.</p>
            <p>You ſay further in the words of <hi>Hezek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah, The children are come to the birth, and there is not ſtrength to bring forth:</hi> Did you ſay it with his ſpirit and faith, you would do as he did, <hi>rend</hi> not your own <hi>clothes,</hi> nor others honors, but your <hi>hearts,</hi> and put <hi>on ſackcloth</hi> and <hi>mourn</hi> before the Lord: Did you believe that <hi>the children were come to the birth,</hi> that deliverance were near, you would not be ſo angry; or did you <hi>travel</hi> with childe your ſelves, you would retire into the chambers of your own Souls, and not be quarreling in the ſtreets, or ſtirring up peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtrife and contention: Or did you think our <hi>Governors,</hi> or any with them were <hi>in travel,</hi> and <hi>wanted ſtrength to bring forth,</hi> you would not by contention weaken them as you do.</p>
            <p>Let it be ſuppos'd then, there is indeed a <hi>great turning aſide from God our Savior,</hi> &amp;c. into enmity, ſelf and pride, what can you think to be the way to recover us? Will the pulling down a <hi>Protector</hi> and his party, with Accuſations, Wrath and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſetting up your ſelves or any other party in a way of Parliament? Will this bring us back <hi>to God</hi> in love, ſelf denial, humility and true holineſs? We cannot believe that you think it will, but that you muſt think with us, that love, inſtruction and forgiveneſs, adminiſtred in the grace and ſpirit of Chriſt, to melt and break mens hearts; theſe are the proper Remedies
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115669:36"/>to recover a back-ſliding people. Now I have gloſs'd upon the ſenſe of the Subſcribers, I ſhall give you a more naked account of my own thoughts concerning this thing in theſe <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, We are eſcaped from an outward <hi>Egypt,</hi> but are ſtill <hi>in that great City Which is ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ually called Sodom and Egypt,</hi> Rev. 11.8. We and our conſciences are free from men, but our ſouls and conſciences are in bondage to darkneſs, to fleſhly luſts, to wrath, pride and ſelf love; while we were under the power of outward enemies theſe durſt not look forth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now free from fear of others, our own naughtineſs begins to appear.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, Theſe noiſom luſts of envy, evil ſurmiſes, pride and ſelf-exaltation, are of the ſame kinde and ſpirit with that tyranny that men exercis'd over us; which being in and amongſt our ſelves, do pierce and wound us more than when they were over us in others.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, We have gotten a greater outward liberty and dominion, than we have wiſdom and ſtrength of grace to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, which is a dangerous evil, to be over loaded with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, proſperity and honor, more than is proportionable to our ſpirits: 'Twas a wiſe deſire of <hi>Agur, Neither poverty nor riches, but food convenie it for me.</hi> A little grace that ſhin'd clearly in a mean condition, may be ſmother'd and choak'd with worldly Greatneſs: when I ſee how little of the <hi>majeſty</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> there is, and how <hi>carnal</hi> mens mindes are, I fear we roſe too ſoon, and are come forth into Power before we are fit for it, or it fit for us; and if it be ſo, we may fear we ſhall lie down aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n in our old Egyptian <hi>graves,</hi> or a worſe <hi>hell,</hi> till by ſome ſharp ſuffering our ſpirits be more refin'd: we do hang over a dangerous pit of confuſion and wrath, by a meer <hi>thred</hi> of Gods good providence, therefore it concerns all, eſpecially our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,</hi> to be very humble, very meek and patient, tender and ſubject to what light ſhall come forth from God; for if God ſhould be provoked but to cut <hi>this thred,</hi> or to take off his hand from protecting of us, we are like to be the moſt miſerable, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable and abominated people in the earth.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, Our corruptions which before lay hid, and in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115669:36"/>this time of freedom break forth, are more than we expected, are noiſom and foul, offenſive to our ſelves and viſible to others, and they come <hi>in as a flood upon us</hi> in all places, in all things, in outward and inward things, in civil and Church affairs ſo much, that we know not how to reſiſt them; neither is there viſibly appearing in any ſort of people a remedy for theſe evils, or a ſpirit able to deal with the huge Armies of Luſts, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread Religion, and men profeſſing godlineſs: This is a great diſappointment, we looked for Peace, Righteouſneſs, Truth and Glory to flouriſh, but behold, Folly, Enmity, Diſtraction, Iniquity and Shame covers our faces: This doth vex and grieve mens hearts, and every man complains of <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and moſt with the Subſcribers, fall upon them that are in power, becauſe they do not cure theſe maladies, and lead us into a better ſtate; generally it cauſes wrath, bitterneſs and rage againſt theſe evils in others, not in our ſelves; not conſidering who it is that ſays, Iſaiah 43.28. <hi>I have profaned the Princes of the ſanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curſe, and Iſrael to reproaches;</hi> not that the reaſon of this great diſpleaſure of God lies at home in every mans heart, if they did conſider this is a divine hand, and the ground of it is in our ſelves, and in the very ſtate in which we are, being much in the fleſh and carnal, we ſhould at leaſt be ſtill and ſilent, and not increaſe our evils by open and ſhameful Quarrels, but rather heal and hide them by Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Fifthly, We in the outward things, as matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are yet intangled in the <hi>maners</hi> and <hi>cuſtoms</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and ignorant of the <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>the Lord,</hi> or of our <hi>own land;</hi> for a way or form of Government of our own that is proper for a godly people, we have not yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us; therefore every one lays hold of ſome broken pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Inſtrument patches up <hi>one</hi> and a <hi>Council,</hi> and the <hi>Old Law</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Subſcribers ſeem to be for a <hi>Parliament</hi> onely; But all theſe things about which we contend, are parts of the <hi>Old Babel,</hi> and the Subſcribers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much in it as any, as we may ſee hereafter: Now theſe things muſt needs vex our ſpirits, having not yet found out a way ſuitable and ſit for us: Though few know what we ayl,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115669:37"/>or what will cure us, onely our feet are in the ſtocks, and our mindes uneaſie and unſatisfied, we kick and ſpurn againſt thoſe that are next us.</p>
            <p>But if the Subſcribers or any others do think, that it is the deſign of the <hi>Protector</hi> Himſelf, or Himſelf and Council, to carry us back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> into a Land of tyranny and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or perſecution, and to make himſelf and poſterity Lords over us there, I will not perſwade your charity to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: There is it may be ſo great a breach, and we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſuch diſmal apprehenſions one of another, that there is no talking of love: But we may ſuppoſe that we have not quite loſt our <hi>reaſon,</hi> though we have our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> do then but uſe your reaſon, and you cannot think that the Protector can be ſo weak as to attempt ſuch a deſign, or ſo ſtrong as to effect it, if he ſhould aim at it.</p>
            <p>For if he would carry us back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> his way were to heal <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to reſtore the <hi>old malignants,</hi> as the proper Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Royalty and Greatneſs, and inſtruments of ſuppreſſing us and our principles of Liberty: One while all the cry of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie was, He favor'd Malignants, that Malignants got up again; but His late acts againſt them take away this doubt, and tell us the breach 'twixt them and him can never be heal'd; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we in <hi>reaſon</hi> think that ever <hi>they</hi> ſhould truſt <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>he them;</hi> For though they do love outward pomp, and tyranny, and perſecution, the companions of it, yet they could not but hate it in him, who is, as they think, a Deſtroyer and Perſecutor of them and their way, neither can he expect any thing from them but all the revenge an inraged enemy can plot or act; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he looks back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he meets with a <hi>Red ſea,</hi> which lately devour'd <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>his hoſt,</hi> the ſame <hi>ſea of blood</hi> waits to receive him if he return.</p>
            <p>If his way to <hi>Egypt</hi> be block'd up, ſo that he muſt reſolve to cleave to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as his onely hopes; Can he think then that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> will turn <hi>Egyptians?</hi> Or do we think that he can debauch the honeſt party, ſo as to blot out of their ſouls all principles of Religion and Liberty, and to make them ſlaves to his luſts of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Tyranny?</hi> Can he think to lull aſleep all thoſe lively awakenings of Courage and Zeal for Liberty, which move ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115669:37"/>highly amongſt us, or to perſwade that <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> that hath overſpread mens mindes (as to outward Freedom) to retire again, and to lie down <hi>in darkneſs,</hi> that he might ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over us unſeen and unfelt: can he or you think, that beſides Diſſenters, that hate the appearance and ſhew of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, there are not thouſands that abhor to bear the Yoke of Slavery from any, much leſs from him a Brother? and if they did not ſee and feel, or hope for (at leaſt) an honeſty and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs in him, would both deſert and oppoſe him? If he ſhould meet with ſome few weak hearted Mungrels that would flatter his Greatneſs, and fall before it; yet ſhould he but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a <hi>Heart</hi> to depart from principles of Liberty to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not onely Paſſion and Diſcontent, but the very heart, life, and ſpirit of Truth and Honeſty in the whole party would with ſcorn reject him: Therefore be is ingaged and hedg'd in, that if he ſhould have a luſt after Ambition, he knows not which way to have it, or how to compaſs it, without apparent ruine to his very ſtanding and being, which is upon the Foundation of <hi>honeſt men</hi> and <hi>honeſt things;</hi> take him off from that bottom, he is the nakedeſt pooreſt wretch in the world, and the moſt ſubject to ſcorn and contempt; and this ſo evident, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee it.</p>
            <p>Neither can I think it hardly poſſible for the <hi>Protector</hi> and they that joyn with him, knowingly and wilfully to deſert that Religion and Cauſe, that hath been laid into their hearts by a deep work upon their Souls long before theſe times, in which they have been bred, born, and form'd by a continual work of God upon them; for which they have often adventured their Lives, Names, Eſtates, and all that they had: A Cauſe and Work that is as natural to them as their lives; yea, now their very <hi>life</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> they having been brought forth with it, to what they are, having no other hopes of ſubſiſtance in the earth, but in it and with it. They may ſtagger and wander in much darkneſs, ſhortneſs and inſufficiency, they may have paſſions and temptations; but that they ſhould of a ſudden, raze out of their ſouls all impreſſions made by God upon them, and the deep ingagements of their ſpirits to this work, and in a ſit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all and eſpouſe another intereſt, cannot without much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice be received.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:115669:38"/>
            <p>Or ſhould I conclude mans heart ſo deceitful and falſe as to do this, yet I muſt then doubt, that the very Religion, and the ſtate in which we are, (when the eminenteſt and ſtrongeſt pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars fail) is not what we have thought it, but that it likewiſe will corrupt and turn to rottenneſs, and all theſe appearings of Light and operations of God, will be utterly loſt in Apoſtaſie, and that we ſhall run back into Darkneſs and Profaneneſs, or Confuſion; I confeſs, I cannot in reaſon admit the one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſad apprehenſions of the other.</p>
            <p>But then I conſider alſo that this Work begun amongſt us, is not ſo much carried on by an inward <hi>Spring of Grace,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Wheels of Providence;</hi> drawing or driving men on into ways and paths, that their own light neither did nor could direct them into; and therefore it depends not upon the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs and truth of mens ſpirits, they having the leaſt ſhare in it: but they and the Work have been carried on upon Engines of Providence, ſo far beyond mens knowledge, that if their hearts ſhould fail, they know not which way to go back; they are caught in ſuch a net, and ſo involved in and with the Work, that they muſt live and die in it, and cannot think how or where to live out of it: which might help to eaſe us of the pain of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie which troubles us, and unite all our hearts and ſpirits to do the utmoſt we can, to maintain what we have got; for we are gone too far to retreat, we muſt think of going forward, but backward we cannot go.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Witneſs or Article begins thus: <hi>That bleſſed Cauſe, and thoſe noble Principles propounded and proſecuted by the old Parliament, &amp;c. are now wholly laid aſide, &amp;c. and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other quite contrary eſpouſed, &amp;c.</hi> I confeſs, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why you ſhould <hi>bleſs the old Parliament,</hi> except it be to <hi>ourſe our new Government:</hi> and why you ſhould <hi>bleſs</hi> them and <hi>ourſe</hi> theſe, I do as much wonder, when I know they were much more oppoſite to your way than theſe are. Neither did the <hi>old Parliament</hi> ever <hi>propound or proſecute,</hi> the <hi>deſtroying of Pariſhes, taking away Tythes,</hi> or <hi>overthrowing of Miniſters,</hi> which are your Cauſe now againſt the preſent <hi>Government,</hi> as you expreſs in the cloſe of your <hi>Paper;</hi> ſure <hi>theſe men</hi> are apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ſuch Work than the <hi>old Parliament:</hi> And why you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115669:38"/>ſhould ſo magnifie any thing that is paſt, as to call it <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> I know not; I confeſs, I never yet ſaw any thing in agitation that could make all parties happy and bleſſed: ſurely nothing is truly <hi>bleſſed,</hi> but that wherein all good men may finde reſt. It may be you plate much of you happineſs in a <hi>Parliament,</hi> for in this Article you plead for the Priviledges of Parliaments; if you do not, many others do think it the onely Cure of our Diſtemper: and therefore I ſhall freely give you my thoughts of <hi>Parliaments:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Parliament</hi> is a Conſtitution in which there is ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Equity, and of late it hath been very benign to <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> for which we may remember it with Honor: but I fear it hath been made an <hi>Idol</hi> by many of us, and exalted above its place, for which, it hath been miſerably blaſted and curs'd, render'd a vain and unprofitable thing, ſubjected to ſcorn and contempt, having loſt its Union, Majeſty and Wiſdom. The Conſiderations that I have long had concerning a Parliament, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, A <hi>Parliament</hi> is a Body, whereof the <hi>King</hi> is the head; and therefore 'twas called <hi>his Parliament,</hi> becauſe form'd and call'd by him at his own pleaſure, for his own ends; and 'twas his Intereſt, which he much pleaded for in the beginning of theſe times, a <hi>Free Parliament;</hi> for, had they been <hi>Free</hi> in their Debates and Votes, he and all his had been undoubtedly ſafe: For the Parliament did zealouſly and heartily intend the advancing of him, and making him a great Prince, and ingaged and proteſted to it; however they were afterward forc'd from their own Proteſtations, but not by any natural motion of their own, but by an over-powering hand. A <hi>Parliament</hi> is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>King</hi> as much the Intereſt of a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, A <hi>Parliament</hi> is a wordly earthly Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſiſting of worldly Matter, Gentlemen of Eſtates, and choſen by People, in the capacity onely of poſſeſſing ſo much Land; without any reſpect at all had in <hi>Electors</hi> or <hi>Elected,</hi> to any <hi>Character of Grace</hi> or <hi>Anointing:</hi> and therefore 'tis the Intereſt of the <hi>World,</hi> not of the <hi>Saints;</hi> a part of the fourth Monarchy, not of the fifth; the ſtrength of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115669:39"/>
               <hi>this world,</hi> not of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> form'd by cuſtom in the Darkneſs and Enmity of the world, not in the Light and Wiſdom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, The <hi>Parliament</hi> had it had its <hi>Priviledges, viz.</hi> Freedom for all its Members to Debate and Vote, would never have removed any thing of <hi>King, Lords</hi> or <hi>Biſhops;</hi> they had all ſtood to this day, had not the Parliament been forc'd by the People. We may talk of <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but, alas, who doth not ſee that we did make bold with their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> by driving ſome out, and driving ſome on beyond their reaſon, to what we and the People affected; and this ſo groſly, that though it might be a ſhame to do it, 'tis more a ſhame to deny it; or to ſeem now to plead for the ſtanding of <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> when common ſenſe or ingenuity will tell us, we have forc'd and violated them at our pleaſures from the beginning.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, We cannot in reaſon expect a <hi>Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at this time, becauſe the People are not fit to have a free choice of Members, or at leaſt not fit in the ſence of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers;</hi> for, generally the ſpirit of the Nation at this time is complaining of Sects and Diviſions in Religion, and jealous that the Anabaptiſt will get the upper hand, and pull down both Magiſtracy and Miniſtry; therefore we cannot but think, give them Freedom to chuſe, they would pitch upon ſober wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that ſhould ſtop this inundation of Innovations in Church and State: Therefore you cannot have a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you admit the People to a <hi>Free Choice,</hi> which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> which indeed, neither the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor any rational honeſt man can admit; for the greater number of the People of the Nation are either Malignant and oppoſing Reformation, or lately offended at it, or Neutral, and ſottiſhly mindleſs of any thing but their profit; all theſe muſt be concluded unfit to be the root of that power that muſt carry on the great Work begun, and ſecure <hi>honeſt men</hi> and honeſt things: And ſhould we reſtrain the Election to <hi>honeſt men,</hi> (for which there is no Law) yet they alſo are for the preſent unfit for choice, being divided into Sects and Parties, and ſo not competent judges of mens ability to govern, but will over value
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115669:39"/>their Friends, and undervalue their Enemies; chuſe an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, becauſe of our own party; and refuſe a worthy man, becauſe oppoſite to us: ſo that the Foundation of a <hi>Parliament</hi> would be laid (though choſen by the beſt men) not onely in bitter ſtrife and enmity, but in unrighteouſneſs and partiality; and what fruit can we expect, but jangling and cavelling, from the root of blinde and unjuſt Contention? But, alas, a Free Choice is out of uſe amongſt us, for the cuſtom hath been, either to awe the People out of their choice by greatneſs, or to cheat them of it by canvaſing and importunities; and ſo either ſome great men, or buſie factious men, have made Parliament-men in moſt places: and the People in whom we would place the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal power, over our Lives, Liberties and Religion, are ſuch fools or beaſts, as to be thus driven in their Election. If we ſhould have a <hi>Parliament</hi> at this time, I ſhould fear it would be like that Beaſt ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2. which did <hi>riſe out of the ſea;</hi> ſo the People or Nation is at this time, a multitude of confuſed Tongues, Languages and Voices, carried this way and that way by the breath and ſpirits of men. And <hi>the Beaſt</hi> was <hi>like a leopard,</hi> full of ſpots of ſeveral and different colours, and of a monſtrous ſhape; the lower parts <hi>the feet as a bear;</hi> the upper parts, <hi>the mouth as a lion:</hi> ſuch would a Parliament be; They might roar as <hi>lions,</hi> ſpeak high things, big words, ſome of them; others be fierce and cruel as <hi>a bear;</hi> but yet <hi>a beaſt,</hi> not of wiſdom, meekneſs, or love, to heal our Diſtractions: for the fury and wrathful ſpirits of the People can blow up no better a <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> than a fierce and raging <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhould this <hi>Parliament</hi> aſſemble and ſit, and aſſume the <hi>Royal power</hi> into their hands, will the <hi>Dragon</hi> (if I may alude to the Army) give them <hi>his Power, his Seat, and his great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi> An <hi>Army</hi> we have and muſt have, and 'tis now Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; can we then think, that they that have the Sword in their hands, be they the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> or any other, will be ſo time, as to ſuffer themſelves to be voted Traitors by ſuch a <hi>Lions mouth,</hi> and to be laid hold on by ſuch a <hi>Bears paws,</hi> and not remove them? For there is no <hi>Parliament</hi> that can meet, if they have the courage to own their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, not onely the <hi>late Acts;</hi> but the very <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Being</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:115669:40"/>of the <hi>Army,</hi> as it now ſtands: And whether there be men to be found upon the earth that will ſuffer this, when they have the Sword, and ſo power to prevent it, and to fave their heads, all may judge; and therefore a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> as it is not poſſible to be had, ſo 'tis not rational to think, that they ſhould <hi>freely ſit</hi> and vote under a ſuperior and different Power; for if they are not a <hi>beaſt,</hi> the Sword will make them one, and drive them which way it pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider what hath been ſaid, That a Parliament is the proper <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> its Head; that it is a <hi>worldly</hi> and <hi>dark Conſtitution,</hi> the Intereſt of the <hi>Nation,</hi> not of the <hi>Saints:</hi> and what it hath formerly done to eſtabliſh our Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, how little it would have done towards a Reformation, had they had their <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Priviledges;</hi> and what an <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>bruitiſh</hi> thing it muſt needs be, if choſen by the People in their preſent condition, and ſitting under another power in poſſeſſion. And we muſt conclude, That a <hi>Parliament</hi> is not a ſeaſonable remedy; and the Subſcribers alſo, if they conſider it, muſt confeſs, a Parliament is as <hi>Egyptian</hi> or Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh as a <hi>King.</hi> It hath been my minde a long time, I ſhall deſire my Countrey men to bear with me if I offend, That a <hi>Government,</hi> wherein there is the leaſt <hi>deſignation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> yea, if it be but the <hi>product of ſucceſs,</hi> if it have in it any thing of <hi>Love or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or the leaſt ſpark or ſpirit of <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> I ſhould prefer it at this time much before a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England;</hi> where I fear there will be little but violent ſtorms of Contention.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath been a <hi>nurſing Mother</hi> to good people, and was kinde to her <hi>nurſling,</hi> while it was a <hi>nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and a childe; the more, becauſe ſhe was fallen out with her husband the <hi>King,</hi> and ſo expected to have ſome help from her childe againſt him: I doubt her love was not natural, but as a <hi>nurſe</hi> and hireling, for her own advantage; if ſhe had ever thought it ſhould have been <hi>wean'd</hi> and taken from her, ſhe would not have been ſo kinde to it. But her breaſts hath been long dry, and ſhe grew froward and imperious, and therefore 'twas but time for the childe when it grew to be a man, to leave ſucking, and to ſhift for it ſelf. If godly and honeſt men
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115669:40"/>were a Body <hi>knit</hi> and <hi>joynted</hi> together, they need not fear ſtanding upon their own legs, and being <hi>wean'd</hi> from <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> neither have we any reaſon to return to her, being in a womaniſh rage and diſtraction, for her loſs of that abſolute Power ſhe lately had, and unjuſtly took upon her. But if theſe <hi>Subſcribers</hi> and other <hi>New-lighted</hi> Men have a minde to be Children again, and to go to School to their <hi>Tutors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,</hi> a <hi>Parliament,</hi> let them but lay down the <hi>Sword,</hi> and if <hi>Madam Nurſe</hi> do not whip them back into Uniformity, to their old Baptiſm and Miniſtry, and at leaſt to the Directory and Orthodox Catechiſm, let them never truſt an <hi>unknown Friend</hi> more.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this Article, I have a little ſerious advice to commend to you my friends the <hi>Subſcribers;</hi> I obſerve when you come to ſum up your <hi>bleſſed Cauſe,</hi> you ſtrangely jumble together heterogeneous matter of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Priviledges of Parliaments, the Liberty of the Subjects;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>A right to our Native Priviledges,</hi> and the <hi>juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of every man.</hi> In confounding theſe things without giving them their place and order, you ſeem to me to be either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ignorant of your Cauſe, the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> or elſe in oppoſition to this preſent Power, have departed very much from it, in mingling ſuch old worldly things with it; which are <hi>old Terms,</hi> but ſurely have no place in this <hi>new Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, make the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> what you will, it conſiſts either in the perſon or ſpirit of Chriſt, as the anointed of God; or in the Saints, being partakers of the ſame anointing: Now for you to place the power onely in a <hi>Parliament,</hi> whoſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is in the choice of an ignorant, carnal, and divided people; of members like themſelves, without mentioning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Deſignation and Ordination to govern, or the anointing and grace of his Spirit in his Saints; you do in this wave the Intereſt of Chriſt and your own Cauſe, I fear, becauſe you would oppoſe theſe Governors, who have a ſhadow of ſome ſuch thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the appointment of Providence, and ſome of them a ſpirit of wiſdom, largeneſs and righteouſneſs, to govern. What ever theſe are, it is not your Intereſt to give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the Nation, that are malignant, or neutral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115669:41"/>and indifferent, or offended at you, equal priviledge with the Saints.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Liberty of the Subject;</hi> what is it more than to be under the Government of our <hi>Soveraign Lord the King,</hi> and to hold our Lands of <hi>him,</hi> or ſome <hi>mean Lord,</hi> under ſuch <hi>Suits</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> ? or to governed by his Laws and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical? What Liberty elſe had we? and what is this to the heirs <hi>of the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> where the Saints ſhall reign as <hi>Kings?</hi> Or would you gratifie the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, in pleading the <hi>Liberty of every man,</hi> what will be their portion when <hi>Chriſt reigns?</hi> Will it not be, think you, at beſt to <hi>bow to the ſoles of the feet</hi> of the Saints? 'Tis true, there is a large righteouſneſs in <hi>Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> and he will <hi>diſtribute Juſtice to every man,</hi> but not in the way wherein this hath been, and is now ſpoken of by you; but in firſt advancing his Saints, and in making others their ſervants.</p>
            <p>And what are our <hi>Native Priviledges?</hi> Is it not, to be born in our own Pariſh, to be Chriſtned by our own Miniſter, to go to our own Pariſh-Church to Divine Service, to follow our Trades and Callings, while the King ſecur'd our Eſtates by his Laws, and our Religion by his Biſhops and Canons? Alas, we were born in <hi>Egpyt,</hi> in the <hi>houſe of Bondage;</hi> me thinks you are very much intangled with the Cuſtoms and Maners of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when you talk at this rate, and very ignorant of what you profeſs the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and the Dignity of the Saints; or elſe you do out of diſcontent, throw your ſelves back into the common ſtate of the Nation, being angry with your Brethren.</p>
            <p>I am of this opinion, that there is a peculiar <hi>Friviledge</hi> and Right of Power or Government due to <hi>honeſt men,</hi> that have with the jeopardy of their lives, reſcued themſelves from Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; which is their due, not by a <hi>Natural birth,</hi> as Men; nor by a <hi>Spiritual birth,</hi> as Chriſtians; but by a <hi>birth of Providence</hi> (if I may ſo call it) whereby they are brought forth into a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, Outward,</hi> and <hi>Military Body,</hi> and intruſted with the power of the <hi>Sword,</hi> and ſo of the Nation: That <hi>Government</hi> that deryed theſe poor people the common Freedom of Life and Being, is totally diſſolved; their Enemies overthrown, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115669:41"/>they that were the <hi>Tail,</hi> made the <hi>Head;</hi> indowed with the moſt <hi>abſolute Power.</hi> 'Tis a thing that the <hi>Protector</hi> hath ſeem'd a long time to deſign, and that good people have talked of, That <hi>Honeſt men</hi> ſhould onely have place and power; and yet now we have it, we either minde it not, or know not which way to ſettle it: I do heartily wiſh, that we underſtood what a <hi>Prize</hi> we have in our <hi>hand,</hi> and had light and judgement, either to keep it juſtly, or to reſign it wiſely.</p>
            <p>Your third Article is this, <hi>The unadviſed and unwarrantable changing of Government, and ſwearing thereunto, &amp;c.</hi> This is the chief of your witneſs, The great offence taken againſt the <hi>Protector,</hi> and indeed the chief difference 'twixt you and him; the very ſubſtance of your Paper, other things being either appurtenances and flouriſhes, or petty inconſiderable things, brought in to make number and weight: but here is the ſtreſs of the buſineſs, and the chief ground of your quarrel, now you come to the point; 'tis an <hi>unadviſed and unwarrantable act,</hi> and, <hi>ſwearing thereunto:</hi> You differ not in Principle, or in your Spirits, or in Work and Ends, onely the Protector hath raſhly and <hi>unadviſedly</hi> clap'd up a <hi>Government,</hi> which you cannot <hi>warrant</hi> to be ſound and good; or a private thing, that hath no publick <hi>Warranty;</hi> neither the conſent of <hi>the People,</hi> nor of <hi>the Honeſt party.</hi> I muſt confeſs, to form a ſtanding <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for three Nations ſo <hi>unadviſedly,</hi> upon ſuch ſlight and ſudden Council; and to have no more Law, Authority, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from men, nor any thing from Heaven to <hi>warrant</hi> it; and then as raſhly by Oath to engage to it, and ſo to involve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, as to render himſelf uncapeable of better Counſels, and a better way if it ſhould appear, is not a thing juſtified by that light either of Religion or Reaſon that I underſtand: And therefore, though I can ſubmit, either to a forc'd and impos'd, or an undue Authority or <hi>Government,</hi> (for I think all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments now in the world are no better) yet if I may ſpeak my minde freely, 'tis this; To huddle up a buſineſs of ſo vaſt a concernment, as the <hi>Government</hi> of three Nations, in a <hi>corner,</hi> in ſuch <hi>haſte,</hi> upon ſo <hi>ſlender advice,</hi> without a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> either from God or men, and to binde it by an <hi>Oath,</hi> is unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, and doth require repentance in them that did it.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115669:42"/>
            <p>But, though I do agree with the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> That this act is <hi>unadviſed</hi> and <hi>unwarrantable,</hi> yet it is upon a different ground; for they ſay, That <hi>change of Government and ſwearing thereunto doth put a neceſſity upon the chief <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker thereof, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the very Foundation of a Commonwealth;</hi> this is <hi>as they judge.</hi> Now I judge, that one great reaſon why that <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Inſtrument</hi> was ſet up and ſworn to, was to uphold the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>old Commonwealth:</hi> and this they did, as I ſuppoſe, in ſome kinde of oppoſition to the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> men; who, as theſe men judged, would have led them by their unſetled principles into a notion or cloud of a <hi>New Kingdom,</hi> from the very <hi>Foundations of an old Commomwealth;</hi> and to avoid this danger, they took the materials that were next, <hi>old Laws and Parliaments,</hi> and a new <hi>Protector</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> which are all <hi>Fundamentals of Government,</hi> and ſo patch'd up the buſineſs in haſte and fear, leſt they ſhould loſe all their footing in a Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Now here I think was their error, That they did re-build what was really pull'd down, and maintain what God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and ſet themſelves and that Power that God had given them, upon a rotten <hi>Foundation,</hi> which is dark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, full of wrath and curſe; which hath <hi>put a neceſſity upon the chief <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker,</hi> to uphold an old ruin'd Houſe, and all the Breaches, Confuſions, perplexed Suits and Quarrels, Enmities and Miſeries occaſioned by our late Civil Wars and Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the weight of which muſt needs be ſo heavy, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but now feel that he did <hi>unadviſedly</hi> in taking up the burthen of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons why I thus judge, are, Firſt, The ancient Form of this Kingdom or Commonwealth, and the Government thereof, is certainly diſſolv'd; and the heart or life of its Union broken, by that irreconcileable breach 'twixt the Head and Body, the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> or People, <hi>A Kingdom</hi> ſo <hi>divided cannot ſtand;</hi> in its moſt eſſential or integral parts, by a continued War, which could never be compos'd, but in the utter deſtruction of one party. The Union betwixt theſe two principal parts being broken, there neceſſarily follow'd, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, a diſſolution and mouldering away of all the other parts;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115669:42"/>ſo that at laſt, there is not one ſtone left upon another, no one piece of the old Building whole: If there be any thing ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'tis not in its place, nor upon its own Baſis, but upheld by force unduly, and to ſerve another <hi>Power,</hi> ſo miſerably broken and ſunk, like a <hi>milſtone caſt into the ſea,</hi> ſo that none knows where her parts are, or which way to re-unite them. All things are ſet at ſuch a diſtance and enmity, in judgement, principles and affections, and things gone ſo far into Oathes and new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; ſo many new Ways and Forms ſet up one upon another, and the old ſo confounded, that they that have the power to do it, cannot move one ſtep rationally cowards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the old frame.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ancient Government</hi> being irrecoverably loſt, and the Kingdom divided into two Armies, and the Kings Army ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and wholly vanquiſhed; you will eaſily conclude in what a condition the Conquerors are; which is this, A General of a gallant conquering Army; commanding all the Forces in three Kingdoms; in excellent order and diſcipline; ſoundly joynted and knit together in love and affection; confirmed by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in great ſervice, with great ſucceſs; that could never be divided by policy, nor ſhaken by force or difficulties; a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, praying, believing, as well as a fighting Army; having the royal ſtamp of ſuch a conſtant ſucceſs, as made them famous and terrible to the world.</p>
            <p>Within this Army lay the hearts and affections of all the Honeſt people of the Nation, having plac'd all their Safety, Liberty, and Lives in it; did heartily engage their Prayers, Purſes, and Perſons with them, as their onely ſtrength againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Army,</hi> and the <hi>Honeſt people</hi> in it, and with it, was ſaid all our Priviledges, our Peace and Freedom, together with the Honor of the Nation, and all the good things that had been pray'd for, ſpoken of, and expected in Reformation; and as ſecure as the Sword and Honeſt hearts could keep them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and ſafely lodg'd within the ſtrength of an Hoſt: or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my encamping about them: an Army being a <hi>Government</hi> as ancient, as natural, as honorable, as rational, and as juſt, as any other kinde of <hi>Government;</hi> I may ſay more, and for us
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115669:43"/>at this time, moſt vigorous, united, abſolute, and ſafe.</p>
            <p>This Army, with theſe People, under their General, having undoubted right to the Sword, which none would or could queſtion; the Malignants felt the power and truth of it, being overcome by it; the Honeſt party have their Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſecured by it: there was the trueſt ſence and reaſon of the Nation for their <hi>ſtanding;</hi> and the ſame ſence and reaſon for <hi>convenient pay,</hi> according to <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> accuſtom'd and beaten out for them.</p>
            <p>This Army and People had an abſolute Freedom (with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and in right judgement) to do what they would, and to diſpoſe themſelves into what ſtate their reaſon ſhould direct them. For as the oppoſite Army, had it prevail'd, the King had been free to have ſettled himſelf upon what terms he and his party could have agreed upon, and none could reſiſt: ſo this party, for ought I know, were as free to chuſe their own way and ground, to ſecure themſelves and their Liberties, according to the beſt juſtice and wiſdom they have.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, what might a General door not do? or what might be his work, having ſuch an opportunity? ſo free, none to oppoſe; all laid level and flat before him; His Forces mighty, his Commiſſion bright and clear, his people and friends united to him, full of vigor and life, freſh as the morning; though dappled with ſome ſpots of Diviſion, troubled with ſome miſts of Fancies, and ſome youthful extravagant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. But me thinks here was an excellent ground to ſtay a while upon, and to ſpend ſome time in cheriſhing the life and power of Godlineſs; in ſtrengthning of Amity and Union; in waiting upon, and incouraging the growth of Light, till it had diſpers'd thoſe morning miſts, which did darken the face of things, in humbling our ſouls, confeſſing our ſins and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and in ſeeking a way of the Lord. If we had ſpent ſome time in ſearching the records of Scripture, in reading and examining what was in the hearts of Gods hidden and holy ones, in enquiring what God might ſpeak in all the Saints, or any one poor Saint; here might we have dwelt in our tents, and with much eaſe <hi>kept the peace,</hi> and rejoyced together in our liberty and ſafety; and taken a full time to conſider and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115669:43"/>adviſe, where we were, what our rights were, what might be the deſign of God in theſe great Revolutions? and to what purpoſe God had brought forth his people into this outward condition, diſtinct from other people, and put ſuch characters of grace upon them; in heaping, ſo many victories upon them in anſwer to their prayers: and ſeeing he had beſtow'd thoſe favors upon them ſever'd from others, owning them rather. than others, to be his own people: whether theſe diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercies did not inſtruct us to reſerve our ſelves in a diſtinct ſtate, wherein we might, even in outward things, walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion and Godlineſs, and not mingle our ſelves again with the world in its profane courſes and cuſtoms; or to have ſtaid here, at leaſt, to know whether God had any more work for us to do, or any further favor to beſtow upon us. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to ſtir from this ground, till we were carried on and lead forth by the <hi>ſame Providence,</hi> by the <hi>ſame light</hi> and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent of honeſt hearts,</hi> that carried us on in all our work, and brought us hither. And that truly had been but juſt and due to the Lord, That he that had the guiding of us in our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and had delivered us, by anſwering of us, in calling upon his name together, ſhould have been attended upon in the ſame publick way, and had the diſpoſe of us and our deliverance in the ſame way of direction, by his Word and Spirit, in the hearts of his own people, by which they were gotten.</p>
            <p>But now when we had gotten our Freedom, not to attend the moving of the ſame ſtream of Light and Providence, of a united and general ſeeking the Lord, in a free and open way; but for the then <hi>General</hi> to ſtep into a private way, by a private ſpirit, of a ſudden; it may be, not willing to bear the burthen of ſo great a truſt, or to bear the cenſure of ſetting up himſelf in ſo abſolute and arbitrary a Power, &amp;c. or, it may be, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt diſtruſt of himſelf, or a doubt of the ſpirits of his Army; or, whether it was a paſſion and offence taken againſt ſome opinions and ways of Honeſt people, or an opinion of and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the old Engliſh <hi>Government;</hi> or an ignorance of, and preſent mindleſneſs of his own ſtanding, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life and power, I know not: but evil there was in it, I fear. Let it be <hi>unadviſed</hi> or <hi>ill adviſed,</hi> I doubt
'twas the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115669:44"/>counſel of ſome who had too great a power with him, either ſome wile Stateſ man, ignorant of the inward life and ſpirit of our work; or I moſt ſuſpect ſome <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who wanted a great Name to begin their <hi>Writs,</hi> and uphold their <hi>Forms</hi> of Law. What ever was in it, to change a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> for an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> to blot out that Royal ſtamp ſet upon him by divine Providence, and to aſſume another from private hands; and to have the Coyn both adulterated and clipt, his Power mingled with others of a baſer ſort, &amp; much diminiſhed, 'twas <hi>unadviſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To extinguiſh an honorable and natural relation to a good People, full of life and love to him, ingaged together by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, experience, and mercies, and to accept of a relation to the whole body of the Nation, full of filth and rottenneſs, unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him, yea, hating and rejecting of him; who, to heal their Breaches and to recover their Loſſes, are as the Horſeleach, that cries, Give, give; and being as unſatisfied as the <hi>Grave</hi> or as the <hi>barren Womb,</hi> that never ſayes, 'Tis enough; they rage and fret againſt him, becauſe he doth no more for them: to Head ſuch a Body was <hi>unadviſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To leave a ſtanding that was large and free, where he might have breathed out his heart amongſt his Brethren in righteous honeſt ways; and walked <hi>upright</hi> in the full ſtature of what <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> he had; and to go into the noiſom and filthy Forms of the world, where his ſpirit is <hi>bowed down</hi> to old Laws and Cuſtoms, that have been always acted by a spirit of cunning, formality and falſhood, exceeding improper for a ſpirit of Simplicity, Truth and Nakedneſs; an outward pomp and ſtate that us'd to be kept up and fill'd with flattery and deceit; the maners of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and where are <hi>Lice, Frogs</hi> and <hi>Sores, &amp;c.</hi> the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and certainly uneaſie for an honeſt heart: this was <hi>unadviſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to change a Power that was <hi>his own,</hi> inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, form'd and begotten by Providence, free and large; in which he might have done all honorable and juſt things: to change this for a <hi>borrow'd</hi> one, and that from we know not who; and this, not onely limited and leſſen'd, but manacled and fetter'd by an Inſtrument, Laws, Parliaments, be they good or bad, wiſe or fooliſh: this was <hi>unadviſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:115669:44"/>
            <p>And for him, who was as a natural Head and Father to the honeſt people in their Military ſtate, to go and impoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the whole Nation, undeſired, unchoſen: 'twas <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he being the <hi>Right</hi> of the Honeſt party, who were brought forth by him to this ſtate, and he brought forth by their Prayers, Hearts and Courage, to what he was; for him to go and diſpoſe of himſelf, without their conſent, in a thing of ſo great concernment, it could not but be an offence to their ſpirits: and was <hi>unwarrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to bring all their Labors and Adventures, all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Blood and Treaſure, all the Victories and Succeſs, that were one common Stock and Treaſury, to expend them, and diſpoſe them to a final iſſue and ſettlement, without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſent; and that thoſe things that were won by the Sword, ſhould be preſently worn by the Robe; and that were gotten by the Faith, Prayer, Spirits, and Lives of Honeſt hearts, ſhould be preſently ſpent upon Law and Policy: 'tis <hi>unwarrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, he might have given the <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> the common Protection that he did to the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> or to the Charters of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> being neceſſary to preſerve Property 'twixt man and man, 'twas but juſt and rational to uphold them as ſubordinate to him in their preſent work, for the adminiſtration of Juſtice; but to incorporate with them, to ſwear to them, to become ſubject to them, they being ſo great ſtrangers and enemies to him and us in that way in which we now are: was both <hi>unadviſed</hi> and <hi>unwarrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we are declaring our judgements, let us ſpeak our thoughts of the <hi>Swearing</hi> to this Inſtrument. I think, with the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> 'twas <hi>unadviſed</hi> and <hi>unwarrantable,</hi> but not of ſuch dangerous conſequence as they imagine: I would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men in breaking Oathes, though raſhly made, 'twere to adde ſin to ſin; but yet Ile tell you my thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hts, that this <hi>Oath</hi> is likely to follow the former Proteſtations and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, being much of the ſame nature; for if the matter or ſubject of an Oath ceaſe and die, the Oath alſo ceaſes. <hi>A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is bound to her husband no longer than he lives;</hi> therefore,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115669:45"/>if we <hi>Swear</hi> to dying and periſhing things, their death doth diſcharge us. Beſides, the People to whom the Protector hath ſworn, will not accept of him nor his <hi>Government,</hi> but have refus'd him in open Parliament, and why he ſhould be bound to them that will not ingage with him, I know no reaſon. It was not intended that this new Obligation ſhould diſſolve the former Standing and Relation; that being more natural and ſubſtantial, this <hi>New</hi> one, but a circumſtance and form, and an addition to the other: Therefore let him wear it as a garment, for ornament or ſtate, as long as 'twill laſt,
'twill wear out as a veſtment, when the life and body, his Military power will endure. He may therefore eſſay it, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Sauls</hi> armor, but when he feels it burthenſom, he'l ſay, He can't skill of it, and caſt it off: Theſe <hi>withs</hi> and <hi>new cords</hi> will not binde <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> next time danger is upon him, I imagine he will break them in pieces, and leave his new Subjects that refuſe him, for his old Friends that love him; or elſe keep <hi>them</hi> in a ſtate of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Servants, and <hi>theſe</hi> in a ſtate of favor as Brethren; them as a <hi>Concubine,</hi> and theſe as a <hi>Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus do your thoughts and my thoughts freely paſs their judgements upon the <hi>Protector</hi> and his Actions; what pretty chequer-work our thoughts make! how we do ring the changes? we agree and we differ, and it matters not much whether we agree or differ. You ſay and I ſay, this Inſtrument and Oath was <hi>unadviſed</hi> and <hi>unwarrantable;</hi> you judge, That it neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Protector to <hi>deſtroy the Foundation of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:</hi> I judge, That it neceſſitates him to uphold <hi>the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of an old decay'd Commonwealth.</hi> You think his new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will <hi>deſtroy the Foundation of a Conmonwealth:</hi> he thinks your new Monarchy will deſtroy the <hi>Foundation of a Commonwealth.</hi> It may be, I think, both parties would do it, and would not do it; that both of you would uphold the old, and you would have a new, but know not well how to do either.</p>
            <p>Theſe are our thoughts ſhot at rovers; it may be they hit, it may be they miſs the mark. Indeed the thoughts of man are very vain things, and know very little of that divine Wiſdom that moves and carries on the ſpirits of men in theſe great
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115669:45"/>revolutions: and therefore, neither you nor I ſhall be ſo fooliſh, I hope, as to inſiſt upon them, or make much account of them, it's enough we have freedom to give them vent. If they may do any good, ſo? If they be vain, let them die and periſh? But for us to think, a State bound to ſteer their courſe by our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a little too much; if they ſhould, contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would keep them in perpetual inſtability: therefore, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as they ſhould not refuſe any light, ſo they ſhould not be ſwayed by opinions and parties, for intereſt, but follow faithfully, ſteddily and uprightly, righteouſneſs and truth, as it manifeſts it ſelf to their own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Now, we have taken the liberty of expreſſing our thoughts, which are various and uncertain, let us conſider, if there be not ſomething more ſerious and certain to be our guide in point of <hi>Government;</hi> a more <hi>ſure Word</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> or Scripture, to which, we ſhould <hi>do well to take heed:</hi> and in that ſure Word we ſhall finde theſe two things, in Rom. 13.1. <hi>The Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> The Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> that then <hi>were the powers,</hi> had uſurp'd the ancient Rights of the Senate and People of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> then Emperor, was a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beaſt: he got this power by his mothers poyſoning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Emperor, and kept it, by his poyſoning the ſon, the true heir; and yet, this power that then was in being, was <hi>ordained of God:</hi> The word ſignifies an <hi>ordering or diſpoſing</hi> things in their place, and that by <hi>Inſtitution</hi> or <hi>Command.</hi> Be the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers good or bad, <hi>he</hi> that knows how to manage <hi>ill</hi> things to <hi>good</hi> ends, in wiſdom <hi>orders</hi> them, and <hi>commands</hi> obedience to them: whence follow theſe Obſervations,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, That God doth himſelf wiſely <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of <hi>power;</hi> it being his own, he gives it to whom he pleaſes, <hi>pulls down</hi> one, and <hi>ſets up</hi> another, as he hath uſe of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, He can and doth <hi>ordain</hi> power, according to his minde, in wiſdom and purity, through and by, not onely <hi>unadviſed and unwarrantable</hi> but <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>abominable</hi> means, and to wicked perſons.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, Chriſtians ſhould look through the miſt of weakneſs, yea, through the thickeſt vail of wickedneſs, to the brightneſs of <hi>Gods hand,</hi> in ſetting up of <hi>power;</hi> and ought wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115669:46"/>to acknowledge the excellency of one, though clouded with the darkneſs of the other.</p>
            <p>And then I would enquire, whether this preſent <hi>diſpoſe of power,</hi> wherein it ſeems to be turn'd aſide, or turn'd back, into wordly ways and forms; or to make <hi>a halt</hi> in them, and not to go forward into the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> be not in great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? The Reaſons of the Queſtion are:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, I queſtion, whether, that <hi>Saints,</hi> as <hi>Saints,</hi> are fit to Govern? and am ſatisfied, That they that offer at it, are in no wiſe prepar'd for it; having neither the wiſdom, nor power, nor the love and righteouſneſs, that will fit them to <hi>govern in Chriſts name</hi> and <hi>way:</hi> and therefore, in love to them, I do dread the miſerable conſequences and miſcarriages of ſuch a <hi>power</hi> in ſuch hands.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, I doubt, whether the World be ripe for ſuch a <hi>diſpenſation of power,</hi> if we had it; for ſuch a diſpenſation, when it comes, will make a ſeparation
'twixt the <hi>Pretious</hi> and the <hi>Vile,</hi> in perſons and things: and that ſpirit that pretends to ſuch a diſpenſation, doth intend ſuch a thing: but yet, not judging by the nature of things, but by the outward likeneſs or unlikeneſs of things and perſons to it ſelf, would thruſt down violently all thoſe perſons that <hi>differ'd</hi> from them, and thoſe things that were <hi>offenſive</hi> to them, and as unreaſonably exalt thoſe that did agree with them; and this, the very nature of that diſpenſation which they profeſs, would lead them to. Now, while things are thus indigeſted, as they are, and mix'd, there is ſome notable good, and great uſefulneſs in many things and perſons, which, we have great reaſon to think, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtanding to be in darkneſs and evil; many good men and things likewiſe, lie ſcatter'd abroad in various forms, and mix'd with many evils: and therefore, for men, being in preſent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and offence, and in great weakneſs and darkneſs, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to judge and ſeparate all theſe, what monſtrous errors muſt needs follow? Therefore I enquire, whether, while things are in this confuſion, a way and ſpirit of Government, ſuitable to it, and that hath ſomething of Religion, ſomething of worldly Policy, be not beſt? And, whether thoſe that are more ſpiritual in their deſigns, and in the eagerneſs of their ſpirits, to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115669:46"/>ſuch a way, be not in mercy laid aſide, till they and the matter be riper and fitter? And whether ſuch have not reaſon to be content, that the World ſhould be thraſh'd a while longer with the violence and hardneſs of its own ways of government, till it be fit to be fann'd, and, till he come whoſe fan is in his hand, rather than to torture their ſpirits and the world too, with that which they can't poſſibly effect, nor the world bear.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle gives one reaſon more of ſubjection to the <hi>powers that be, ver.</hi> 4. <hi>He is the miniſter of God to thee for good:</hi> The ſafety of thy perſon and family, the peace of the countrey, the liberty of thy religion, the enjoyment of thy goods, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred from <hi>God</hi> to thee <hi>by them;</hi> therefore, ſubject for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake,</hi> to <hi>Gods wiſe ordination,</hi> who knows what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are fit for a people; and to <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys ſo great bleſſings by that means.</p>
            <p>This we cannot be inſenſible of, that we do by this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enjoy great quiet, peace, and ſecurity, in our Religion, Relations, and Eſtates, to our ſelves, and to the Nation, being not moleſted by any at home, nor by dangers abroad; we may therefore obſerve, That perſonal weakneſs, in attaining a Power, makes that Government, to him that hath it, harder, but to the people, eaſier. I think 'tis ſo with us, that though the <hi>Protector,</hi> by this <hi>unadviſed and unwarrantable</hi> change of Government, hath brought a heavy burthen of cares, dangers, and ſore travel upon himſelf, yet I know not, but that the people are both eaſed, as to burthens at home, and ſecur'd from dangers abroad, by it. This very conſideration, That we reap the quiet fruit of his hazards and toil, doth affect my heart with a very great deſire of giving him all the eaſe and relief that I am able; for let men fancy what they will, ſo great and general a Liberty for the Honeſt party, guilty of ſo many diſtaſteful and offenſive Infirmities, with ſo great Diviſions and Diſtractions, and their Enemies, ſo many and malicious, is to me a wonderful mercy; and is purchas'd for us, by the chief inſtrument of it, with perilous difficulties, and abilities ſtretch'd to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>I fear, that out of an officious deſire of removing and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115669:47"/>offence on both ſides, I have been more large and intent, than the nature of the ſubject doth require; and therefore am reſolv'd, the principal things being already diſcours'd, lightly to paſs over what follows, onely with ſome ſhort Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p>The fourth Article contains the ſame thing, with part of the former, and begins thus; <hi>As a conſequence and fruit of this forbidden tree, many of the choice ſervants of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are impriſon'd, without knowing their accuſers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or a fair and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick trial, according to the Fundamental Laws the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, <hi>Government</hi> is indeed a <hi>Forbidden tree;</hi> it will not ſubject it ſelf to be queſtion'd by any, its work and authority being above private and captious reaſonings.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, Our Government, is in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of it, <hi>Military,</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> is active and vigilant, like that which the Cherubin had, which <hi>turn'd every way;</hi> therefore, which way ſoever danger comes, be it from Friends or Foes, it <hi>turns its edge againſt their faces,</hi> as you complain in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Article, and is as hard as 'tis quick, it ſpares none to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a publick Peace: This <hi>Sword is not borne in vain, but is a revenger, to execute wrath upon them that do evil,</hi> Rom. 13.4.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, This tree of life, the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> is fenc'd with a <hi>flaming Sword,</hi> you cannot preſs into this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe or Kingdom, by ſuch force as you uſe; you cannot take it from others by <hi>violence,</hi> it is indeed within you; and you muſt bring forth the <hi>fruit</hi> of it, by <hi>your lips,</hi> for others, and there onely 'tis to be taſted.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, Military Government, as ours is, knows no form of Law; or, at leaſt, will not ſubmit it ſelf to the Law, though it may require private Differences to ſubject to it, yet is it ſelf above Law.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Fifthly, I doubt the <hi>trial</hi> of ſuch Gentlemen, &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> would not be to them a <hi>fuir trial,</hi> but a foul one, for it could not but cut them off, as the Law now, ſtands; and therefore, the <hi>Protector</hi> chuſes a <hi>fair impriſonment,</hi> rather than a <hi>bloody trial,</hi> not willing to truſt their lives in the hand of the Law, a Judge and a Jury; which to me is a teſtimony, that his Government, is not onely
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115669:47"/>in this, but in all things elſe, more fatherly to you, than the Laws for which you plead.</p>
            <p>Give me but leave to tell you the frequent thoughts of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator upon theſe tranſactions; they are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> I. That in the trueſt love of my heart, <hi>to them that are impriſon'd,</hi> yea, in the ſame love I have to my ſelf, I have thought, that while their ſpirits are thus acted, 'tis better for them to be in a <hi>Priſon,</hi> than upon the <hi>Throne;</hi> to be under <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> than in <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> II. That our <hi>Governors</hi> had much the better of the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> in meekneſs, moderation, and long-ſuffering, from what I have obſerv'd: In their deſires of agreement, ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to wrath, tenderneſs in inflicting reſtraint, ſeeking of peace after they were reſtrain'd; as if they would not touch a hair of their heads, onely binde their hands from doing miſchief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> III. That the <hi>Priſoners</hi> were more fierce, and did more injury to our <hi>Governors,</hi> than our <hi>Governors</hi> to them, ſo that our <hi>Goevrnors</hi> are indeed the ſufferers; for how ſmall a thing is a gentle outward reſtraint? But <hi>tongues are ſwords,</hi> and when ſharpned with Zeal, furbuſh'd with Scriptures, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Preaching, they cut deep into Name and Spirit; for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſons to be ſentenc'd and condemn'd in the name of God, in publick Aſſemblies, as thieves, oppreſſors, perjur'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hypocrites, apoſtates: If it be but in <hi>paſſion</hi> and <hi>diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> 'tis a croſs; but if there be any thing of the truth or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Man</hi> in it, or the diſpleaſure of <hi>God,</hi> 't would be a ſore crucifying to any private perſon, and muſt be much more, to perſons in authority, <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>publick Safety</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with them.</p>
            <p>There is an Objection in your former Article, which is a branch of this ſubject: They are <hi>impriſon'd,</hi> ſay you, <hi>for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Conſciences;</hi> concerning which, I ſhall barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe Queſtions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> I. Whether there be in any of theſe wordly things, an act of <hi>pure Conſcience?</hi> Or whether the ſubject matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outward things, as Government, Power, &amp;c. <hi>Conſcience</hi> be not at leaſt mix'd with Intereſt, Faction and Paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> II. Whether there be not reaſon to judge, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115669:48"/>to the rate that <hi>Conſcience</hi> now goes at) that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi> is bound to keep Peace, and prevent a War; by the law of <hi>Conſcience</hi> to preſerve other mens lives, as well as by the law of Nature to ſave his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> III. Suppoſe <hi>one Conſcience</hi> hath a minde to keep <hi>Peace, another</hi> hath a minde to make <hi>War,</hi> which of theſe ſhould we, that are indifferent people, count the beſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> IV. If in matters of publick Concernment, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> of publick perſons and private perſons juſtle; which of them do you think ſhould take place?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> V. If two Conſciences croſs each other in their motions, whether that which hath moſt light and ſtrength, and is moſt pure, ſhould not yield to that which is darker and weaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> VI. Whether then the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> who profeſs <hi>Conſcience</hi> onely, and ſtand in the ſingle right of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ought not to yield to the <hi>Conſcience of Governors,</hi> cumber'd with reaſon of State, publick Affairs?</p>
            <p>I dare not engage too far in this point of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> nor be too ſerious in it, therefore have I thus ſlightly paſs'd it over.</p>
            <p>The fifth Article ſays, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder pretence of Neceſſity, ſtill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the heavy burthens of Taxes, Cuſtoms, Exciſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> I. An Army is neceſſary, till there be a <hi>Government</hi> eſtabliſh'd, by the declar'd conſent of the People, and that voluntary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> II. 'Tis probable, ſuch an eſtabliſh'd <hi>Government,</hi> were it never ſo firmly united, yet would not, as the ſtate of Affairs are at this time, be without a ſtanding Army, though well im prov'd and reduc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> III. 'Tis the original and great Quarrel twixt us and the King, who ſhould have the <hi>Militia;</hi> and we have prevail'd, and got the <hi>Sword</hi> into honeſt mens hands; he that deſigns the overthrow of the Army, gives the whole Cauſe back to the Cavalier, and opens a way for him to return to his power and malice: 'twas <hi>force,</hi> not <hi>law</hi> or <hi>reaſon,</hi> which ſubdued him, and it muſt be <hi>force,</hi> not <hi>law</hi> or <hi>reaſon,</hi> that ſtill ſubjects him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> IV. He that propounds a Power to ſtand now
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115669:48"/>without an Army, requires from another, what he would not do himſelf; he doth but declare againſt the Sword, that he might get it into his hands: and this is the meaning, I think, of this Paper, to tell us of Peace, to perſwade others to lay down the Sword, that they may take it up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> V. An Army is as neceſſary to preſerve the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers,</hi> as any ſort of people, they being as much obnoxious to the malignity and rage of the people, as any others; and would firſt feel the wane of a Guard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> VI. If an Army be neceſſary, Pay is neceſſary; and ſo, Taxes, Cuſtoms, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But indeed, 'Tis not Saint-like to complain of Taxes, or to reſiſt them. 'Tis the cry of the <hi>Malignant,</hi> and of the poor <hi>Neuter,</hi> Taxes, Excize, &amp;c. and they may be pitied; for alas, they loſe their Religion, and yet pay for our Liberty, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which is grievous to them: but we that once would have given <hi>half</hi> of our Eſtates, for <hi>half</hi> that Freedom that we now enjoy for our ſouls, in the things of God; now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, ſhews, either no love, the freedom of our ſouls, leſs, or our money, more.</p>
            <p>I think, 'tis viſible, that our Governors impoſe no more than is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and that they ſtrain and ſtretch things to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, being unwilling to exceed the <hi>loweſt rate</hi> of <hi>Taxes;</hi> and that they really <hi>pinch</hi> themſelves to <hi>ſave</hi> the people.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Article ſays, <hi>Notwithſtanding the fair pretences and promiſes of Reformation, yet what abominable and horrible Impieties, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could wiſh you did but ſee, how ill it becomes Saints to beſtow their Rhethorick upon <hi>Sin,</hi> to ſet it forth in its bravery; and how ill it becomes <hi>Sin,</hi> to wear ſuch gay clothes of high language from your mouthes? And how ſin is cheriſh'd, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led forth into open view, by the hand of her beſt friend, <hi>Enmity,</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> 'twixt brethren; and that you knew, that the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>good ſpirit</hi> of love that covers ſin, that buries it in inward ſorrow, or in Chriſt his grave, or draws forth grace and mercy to waſh it away, that's the ſpirit, <hi>that</hi> is ſins onely enemy.</p>
            <p>Theſe great Epithites and Strains being misplac'd, I doubt,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115669:49"/>they are alſo unjuſt; paſſionate and affected ſpeech of others evils, are commonly inordinate and injurious. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, <hi>Receiving the Honors, Profits, Cuſtoms, Benefits, &amp;c. coming in formerly to the Crown:</hi> If this be <hi>abominable and horrible,</hi> its very common: I believe, there is ſcarce a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> or any other perſon of quality, but receives, either Honor or Profit, that formerly belong'd to the Crown: For, both the Honor and Profits, are ſhar'd generally amongſt all ſorts, Fee-farm Rents, and other Lands, the Honor and Power of all <hi>Committees</hi> over the people, to ſequeſter, to levy money, to diſpoſe livings, are of the Crown.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, <hi>Tenths and Firſt-fruits:</hi> 'Tis the continuing things in name, <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but now in their uſe, <hi>Moral and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> as ſubſervient to <hi>mercy,</hi> in relieving hundreds of poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: And theſe upheld, not in oppoſition to light, nor in a ſuperſtitious love to the things, but, becauſe <hi>they</hi> yet know not, nor do <hi>you</hi> inſtruct them, how to take them away without great injury to many people, that have no other livelihood in the earth. Love is the <hi>royal law,</hi> the <hi>fulfilling of the law;</hi> it may, and muſt, rule all things, yea, both Law and Goſpel too; it makes that lawful, which were otherwiſe unlawful; and that unlawful, (if againſt love) which were other wiſe lawful: And therefore, a man may be a <hi>Phariſee</hi> in contending againſt <hi>Tythes,</hi> as well as in a rigid obſervance of them, if he either omit or oppoſe the <hi>weightier matters of the law, judgement and mercy;</hi> ſuch a ſpirit ſeems to carry you in this zeal, to ſacrifice Tythes and Firſt-fruits, without either <hi>judgement,</hi> to ſhew how it may be done in juſtice and righteouſneſs, and without <hi>mercy,</hi> in conſidering the poor Miniſters that live onely upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, The next branch of <hi>abominable and horrible Impieties, is, The exalting of Sons, Servants, Friends, &amp;c. (though ſome of them known to be wicked men) to the higheſt places, &amp;c.</hi> What <hi>Servants</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi> are preferr'd, that are ſuſpected to be <hi>wicked,</hi> I know not, being no <hi>Courtier,</hi> but for <hi>Sons,</hi> they ſtand higher, and are obvious to moſt mens knowledge or obſervation: I dare not <hi>ſay,</hi> neither do I <hi>know</hi> that any of them are <hi>wicked;</hi> they are yong men, and may have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115669:49"/>weakneſs; but <hi>wickedneſs</hi> is a malicious oppoſing of good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and practiſing evil.</p>
            <p>But would you conſider the Protectors family, as an object of greater Envy, and ſubjected to more danger and malice than others are, may they not deſerve a little more favor than ordinary? and what great matters have they? The eldeſt ſon is a Juſtice of Peace in the Countrey, the ſecond ſon commands the Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein there may be ſome favor ſhew'd to him, being an Imployment poſſibly beyond his years and experience; I doubt this is the Offence, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fame goes he inclines to a differing party: For his ſons by marriage, The <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> is a friend to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, and may help to ballance ſome kindneſs that goes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way: For the <hi>Maſter of the Horſe,</hi> if he do but perform that part of a <hi>righteous man,</hi> to <hi>regard the life of his beaſt,</hi> you will not judge him <hi>a wicked man,</hi> nor unworthy of his <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> But if the <hi>Protector</hi> ſhould be an indulgent father, and erre in an exceſs of natural affection in preferring his children, it may finde a better name than <hi>abominable and horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties:</hi> For <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 'Tis not ſaid expreſly, that I know, in Scripture, what they did for their children; but there was as a good man, and as good a Governor, <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had but two ſons, and he made them Judges in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet very ill men, that were <hi>covetous, took bribes, perverted judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 Sam 8.3. and yet he was not thus upbraided.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, The laſt particular of theſe <hi>horrible and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Impieties,</hi> is <hi>ſo many Officers in the Army, and both Officers and Soldiers to receive their pay in a time of peace,</hi> &amp;c. What number of Officers, what their Pay is, and how they ſpend it, I do not know, being a ſtranger to all theſe things, onely I would adviſe you of a miſtake to call this <hi>a time of peace;</hi> for though the <hi>Enemy</hi> be not in the <hi>field,</hi> he is in the <hi>houſe.</hi> The enemy is broken and ſcatter'd, but you can't ſay, he <hi>is not:</hi> if he were <hi>not,</hi> we are enemies one to another: there is war in every mans heart, tongue, and would be in the hands, if they were not bound by an <hi>Army;</hi> There is nothing at all done in the Nation towards a civil or religious Peace or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, nothing declar'd wherein we agree either in Church or State.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:115669:50"/>
            <p>This very Paper of yours cannot but be interpreted <hi>War:</hi> for ſo great a number of people <hi>(a little Welſh Army)</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the preſent Power, to diſſwade the people from their obedience, to endeavor to ſet up another, and that upon fighting principles, is undoubtedly <hi>War;</hi> therefore if you would have the <hi>Army reduc'd,</hi> ſtudy to be quiet, and to follow your private occaſions, for theſe <hi>inſurrecting practiſes</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the people, and moleſt the preſent Government, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate and eſtabliſh the ſword amongſt us; and therefore we that do deſire Peace, and an Eaſe of our Burthens, have cauſe to complain of the unquietneſs of your ſpirits, and of all that go fretting and rayling about to raiſe up ſtrife and <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh Teſtimony mentions <hi>the ſad effects of the ſecret Deſign of Hiſpaniola,</hi> &amp;c. I am not able to judge abſolutely of the good or evil of this Work; but this I know, 'tis not ſafe to judge by the Succeſs, eſpecially at firſt; for we our ſelves ſucceeded but ill in the beginning of theſe wars; I fear you do but take advantage of <hi>our loſs,</hi> to expreſs <hi>your enmity:</hi> for if we are not miſtaken in you, you are for <hi>war</hi> with all the world, and therefore can't be againſt the <hi>Deſign,</hi> though you <hi>grieve for the Succeſs;</hi> and 'twere well if you don't miſ-call the Affection, and ſay 'tis <hi>Grief</hi> fox the Loſs, when 'tis anger or enmity at the perſons, and then you do not grieve, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the evil that befals your brethren.</p>
            <p>What ever the nature of the <hi>Deſign</hi> be, or what ever the <hi>Succeſs</hi> may be, this I have obſerv'd, that this Quarrel with <hi>Spain,</hi> and about the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> hath been long in the hearts of many honeſt people, and that the well-affected of <hi>England</hi> have had a greater antipathy to this proud, cruel, and moſt antichriſtian Nation, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than to any Nation in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> Though the Deſign was laid in private, yet the publick Declaration ſhews a true Engliſh and Proteſtant ſpirit, rather to ingage in <hi>war</hi> than to ſubmit to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and the uſurp'd Tyranny over the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> I confeſs I much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and love a General Agreement of <hi>Godly men</hi> in publick and great Affairs; but if there be the ſpirit, reaſon and juſtice of the good party, I cannot but alow it, though it want the vote and outward ſuffrage.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:115669:50"/>
            <p>Your laſt Witneſs is various, conſiſting of divers parts, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I do not well underſtand all things in it: Firſt you teſtifie for your ſelves, with what hearts <hi>you joyn'd with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Army againſt the King and his Party, that you had no other deſign, ſave as they were enemies to our Lord Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. I know your ſpirits are at a very great diſtance and enmity againſt the King and his Party, and therefore cannot think you intend to beſpeak their good thoughts of you: yet your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring onely againſt the <hi>enmity,</hi> not againſt <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> and your care of the <hi>general good of the Nation, particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and juſt liberty of every man,</hi> and your grief <hi>that any juſt cauſe is given them to ſtumble,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or complain that they are deprived of their freedom, and ſeveral ways oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Expreſſions make me doubt that you intend ſome ſubtile glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of favor to that Party, which doth minde me of an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that I have made upon my own and others ſpirits: That if any through Offence at the great Weakneſs or Miſcarriage of the honeſt party, do ſeparate from them, and oppoſe them, they are, though unwillingly and unwittingly, carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirit of the Malignants; we may hate their way, and to confederate with their perſons or actions, yet our ſpirits may be tainted. The Nation is cleft into theſe two great Parties, the <hi>Royal</hi> and the <hi>Reforming</hi> party; or the <hi>Kings</hi> party and the <hi>Army</hi> party; and he that by diſcontent goes far from the <hi>one,</hi> will be carried off to the <hi>other</hi> before he is aware: there is a kinde of neceſſity, if the affections do ingage,
'twill be with one of theſe two: Enmity ſtrangely transforms the minde, and leads it into things exceeding contrary to it ſelf, and its own intereſt, to things deſtructive to Friends, Relations and a mans own Life; therefore if malice prevail, 'twill make very honeſt men malignants preſently; and hence it was that <hi>Elijah</hi> in a fit of anger became an enemy to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded againſt</hi> them, Romans 11.2. as we have formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>That it never came into your hearts to think or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the pulling down of one perſon to ſet up another, or one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Power to promote another:</hi> If you did (as you ſay) <hi>joyn againſt the King onely as an enemy to Chriſt, his kingdom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115669:51"/>and people,</hi> then you might deſign (and for ought I know juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the pulling down of <hi>one</hi> that was an <hi>enemy,</hi> and ſetting up <hi>another</hi> that was a <hi>friend</hi> to the <hi>kingdom and people of Chriſt;</hi> But this I doubt is not your intention (however this clauſe came in <hi>againſt the King, ſave as an enemy</hi>) for it follows, <hi>nor one unrighteous Power to promote another;</hi> by which, and other things in your Paper, you ſeem to make Government by <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to be an <hi>unrighteous Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe you ſeem to me to be either dark or various, in this Article, I ſhall freely give you my Animadverſions, if they may be of uſe to you, I ſhall be glad.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, Power in <hi>one</hi> as ſupream, is not unrighteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in <hi>one:</hi> That which is moſt agreeable to rule, is moſt righteous: Government by one as head, is moſt agreeable to the higheſt rule, the <hi>kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> which is a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to the rule of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of Nations: And Power in the hands of one as ſupream, with the aſſiſtance of a double Council; one more ſuperior of the <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>honorable</hi> Worthies, and another more large of the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>juſteſt</hi> of the people, is I think the beſt Conſtitution, and according to a <hi>divine patern;</hi> therefore if either Heavenly things, Scripture, Nature, Reaſon or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom be a Rule, <hi>Monarchy</hi> is more righteous than <hi>Oligarchy</hi> or <hi>Democracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, If the kinde of Government be admitted, let us come nearer and ſee whether this perſon have right to be this <hi>One ſupream,</hi> or to be <hi>Protector;</hi> for this <hi>Perſon is chiefly concern'd</hi> in your Paper, as you ſay in your Poſtſcript, which puts us again upon the conſideration of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> you have an accompt of him in 19, 20, and 21 pages, which is more it may be than will be judged fit for me to write, either by him or you: I am very ſenſible that I write as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Not after the Lord, but as it were fooliſhly,</hi> not in that wiſdom that becomes one that profeſſes the Lord, but fooliſhly, and knowing it to be weak, yet can't avoid it, the fooliſhneſs of mens ignorance and malice neceſſitating and bowing me to it.</p>
            <p>The common right of Succeſſion, according to law, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:115669:51"/>hath not: if this be rule, the Kings power was <hi>righteous,</hi> this <hi>unrighteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Right</hi> of the Protector to be <hi>ſupream,</hi> is not in relation to the people of the Nation in general, except it be by conqueſt: If you look upon him in this large conſideration, his Power ſeems to be forc'd, there being no Law or Conſent of the People to make him ſo; but the honeſt party are indeed the foundation of his Power: For they, and thoſe that have adher'd to this Cauſe, have by theſe Revolutions gotten the <hi>Power</hi> into their hands, not as <hi>Saints,</hi> but as the effect of Providence, ariſing out of the <hi>Nature, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of things as they now are.</p>
            <p>I ſhall barely aſſert this, and not now ſtand to prove it, or to give the reaſon of it, ſuppoſing the <hi>Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> and others ready enough to receive it, and reſolv'd to keep it; neither do I ſee how honeſt men can reſign this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they have, without giving up themſelves and all they have, to their Enemies rage: If we have a <hi>right</hi> to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to others, the <hi>Protector</hi> hath a very <hi>natural right</hi> to be our Chief, ſtanding upon our ſhoulders, and hath, I think, as good a <hi>Title</hi> to be <hi>Supream</hi> over this people, as any <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in</hi> Wales <hi>or others,</hi> have to be a Committee man, Juſtice of the Peace, Captain, or to enjoy any Lands, or Revenues gotten by the ſword: He that denies him to be what he is, may as well deny the whole party all the Advantage they have gotten by the war: I think we ought to conſider the honeſt party, as a diſtinct people from and above others, and then his <hi>right</hi> to be their <hi>head,</hi> ſtands upon thoſe two grounds expreſs'd by the Iſraelites to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, <hi>Behold, we are thy bone and thy fleſh,</hi> thou art natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to us, and we to thee, of the ſame kinde of life, ſpirit and heart, the ſame bone and ſtrength of Faith, Zeal, Power and Godlineſs: Of the ſame fleſh, the ſame ſenſe of good and evil, the ſame affections to God and Religion, the ſame gifts, the ſame intereſt, the ſame liberty for the ſame conſcience, the ſame peace, the ſame enemies, loved and hated by the ſame, onely <hi>He</hi> more eminently.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, <hi>Alſo in times paſt, thou waſt he that leddeſt out and broughteſt in Iſrael:</hi> Thou haſt deſerv'd to <hi>head</hi> us,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115669:52"/>for thou haſt had the Command of us, and haſt led us forth upon Deſigns wiſely, and brought us back with ſafety and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, therefore <hi>thou ſhalt be Captain over Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall onely let you ſee now the difference between the perſon pull'd down, and this one ſet up, or the Righteouſneſs and Mercy of this Power above that: That perſon was not onely a ſtranger to us, but an enemy: This is according to rule, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15. <hi>From among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet a King over thee:</hi> And according to promiſe <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Their nobles ſhall be of themſelves, and their Governor ſhall proceed from the midſt them:</hi> And ſecondly, the other had the right of <hi>birth</hi> from an ill root: but this of <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>worth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, That is a <hi>righteous Power</hi> which fulfils its <hi>end,</hi> and adminiſters that <hi>good</hi> to the people that is appointed by God, and that <hi>good</hi> that is both general or publick, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all: Now the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of this Power that is evident even to <hi>nature</hi> and common <hi>reaſon,</hi> is to adminiſter Safety and Peace to this Nation, and eſpecially to honeſt people; and this the <hi>Protector</hi> doth do, and is excellently furniſhed with Abilities for that purpoſe: Firſt in the might, vigor, vigilancy and courage of his ſpirit in reſiſting and ſuppreſſing the moſt induſtrious and unwearied Attempts of our old Enemies: Secondly, in a wiſe and large comprehending and moderating the Diviſions and Factions amongſt our ſelves, if his ſpirit ſhould deſpond or flag in the firſt, or narrow and ſhrink into any one party, and turn enemy to any others, 'twere a plain gap open'd for ruine to come in upon us: I muſt be ſo fooliſh as to tell you my thoughts, when I have conſider'd the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate malice of his and our enemies, the croſs and violent winds that move mens mindes, the continual tempeſts of the peoples rage, I have judged him the fitteſt man in the earth to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us in this Scene of Action, and that <hi>Power</hi> was moſt <hi>rightly</hi> and <hi>duely</hi> plac'd in him: Let him have all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of an <hi>Army,</hi> of <hi>civil Honor</hi> and Title of <hi>Protector,</hi> let him be alowed, all his weakneſs, his heights and heats, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and compliance, if he keeps the Ship from ſinking, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the honor of a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>right Pilate:</hi> Several perſons and parties have different apprehenſions of the <hi>work</hi> of this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115669:52"/>
               <hi>Power,</hi> that it is to, ſet up the <hi>kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> after our way, ſays the <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> after our way, ſays the <hi>Subſcribers;</hi> to advance our way, ſay the <hi>Independents;</hi> to encourage godly ſpiritual men, ſay another ſort; to give abſolute liberty, ſay others; but theſe are but private opinions in things, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are diſputable and remote from Government, urg'd by Faction and Partiality, dangerous ſhelves and rocks; but to preſerve us in Peace and Safety from violence, blood and confuſion, is a work unqueſtionably evident in the Light of God, of Nature, of Religion, of Humanity; and ſo far as he doth this, he fulfils the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>power</hi> at this time.</p>
            <p>Now obſerve the difference 'twixt that which was pull'd down, and this ſet up: That had Names and Titles, <hi>By the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> but either void and empty things, or fill'd with contrary and oppoſite qualities; either living to eaſe and worldly pomp, or elſe in enmity to the <hi>grace of God</hi> and <hi>true Faith:</hi> this is unrighteous, to have <hi>Power,</hi> and not to fulfil it; but in this Power we have ſtuff, ſubſtance &amp; ability to perform the work of <hi>Power,</hi> which is, to protect us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, There is yet a <hi>fourth</hi> and higher ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a <hi>Power</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>righteous (i.e.)</hi> with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſneſs of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is proper onely to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>kingdom,</hi> whoſe Scepter is <hi>a righteous Scepter:</hi> who is that King that ſhall <hi>reign in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Princes ſhall rule in judgement,</hi> Iſa. 32.1. and <hi>the work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 17. Now if this be your <hi>witneſs,</hi> that this Power is not thus <hi>righteous,</hi> we are of the ſame minde, and ſo I ſuppoſe is he that hath the <hi>Power:</hi> ſo we admit your <hi>witneſs</hi> true, but not in judgement, being againſt a thing not in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion nor challeng'd; for alas, what is there amongſt us that looks like the Majeſty, Beauty, Judgement, Peace and Glory of ſuch a <hi>Kingdom?</hi> We are poor dark creatures, pudling in the dirt and rubbiſh of a broken world, onely ſtriving for a being and ſubſiſtence, with the beſt humane diligence, wiſdom and honeſty we have; but if this be the intent of your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</p>
            <p n="1">I. Why may not we <hi>teſtifie</hi> more largely of perſons, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Miniſtry, that there is <hi>none righteous, no not one, all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115669:53"/>have ſinned and come ſhort of this glory;</hi> neither Ruler nor People <hi>righteous</hi> with this <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> no Church nor its Rulers, no family nor its ruler, no perſon in his own ſoul, and the Government of it, is thus <hi>righteous;</hi> but iniquity, deceit, vanity, impurity, injuſtice defiles us all, in all things.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whether a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> be not more juſt; that they pretend to and profeſs for this <hi>righteous kingdom,</hi> as if they had it amongſt them, and would or could ſet it up, if they had <hi>power,</hi> whereas they are as weak, as dark, as ſinful as other men.</p>
            <p>But here lies I think a great miſtake amongſt us, and that which much troubles us, We had <hi>high looks,</hi> expected great matters, while we have onely look'd at the promiſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and what is contain'd in them, but have not humbly and ſoberly conſider'd our own preſent ſtate, which is indeed miſerably corrupt and wretched; This hath raiſed expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of greater Matters than it pleaſes God to do for us, or I fear will do till we return into our ſelves, and are more ſenſible of our own great inſufficiency for ſuch things that we dream of; being diſappointed, we vex and free againſt <hi>Governors,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting they ſhould be <hi>Gods</hi> to us, when we ought indeed to put our mouthes in the duſt, and confeſs we have all <hi>ſinned, and come ſhort of that glory</hi> which we have profeſs'd.</p>
            <p>It is not meet to ſay this <hi>kingdom</hi> is <hi>far from us,</hi> though there be a truth in it, as Chriſt tells them that looked that the <hi>kingdom of God ſhould immediately appear,</hi> Luke 19.11. that he was <hi>to go into a far countrey, &amp;c.</hi> But this however I may ſay: We we <hi>far from the kingdom of God,</hi> being in darkneſs, enmity, in ſin, guilt &amp; wrath, and adminiſtring little elſe one to another.</p>
            <p>And therefore this deſire and hopes of great Glory, Honor and Dominion to be diſpenced to us, and the wrath that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us for want of it, is I judge, a luſting after a <hi>fleſhly kingdom and glory,</hi> and that to our <hi>ſelves</hi> and our own party; whereas the kingdom of Chriſt will ſave <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> and the earth too; and it riſes from a vain pride of our ſelves, and ſome excellency we think to be in our gifts &amp; miniſtries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſenſe of that deep and inward corruption that is within; Therefore before this kingdom come that you ſpeak of, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115669:53"/>a more pure Miniſtry, like that of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> That will make <hi>crocked things ſtraight; rough things, plain; and exalt the valleys, bring down every mountain; that all fleſh may ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> This Miniſtry will level theſe high thoughts of yours; and therefore, in ſtead of quarrelling for a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> know you are but <hi>Servants,</hi> and be willing to travel and work with your brethren, in that mean and low ſtate in which they are, for peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p>Let me deſire you to conſider a ſerious word of reproof to you: You are gotten a ſtep higher than your Brethren in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are exercis'd with the thoughts of a future and more excellent ſtate of things, and buſie your heads and mindes in pleaſing ſpeculations about <hi>Chriſts Kingdom.</hi> Firſt, I fear, this is a very imperfect, if not a falſe view, of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe, this Kingdom is <hi>within,</hi> enjoy'd and poſſeſs'd before 'tis ſeen, or ſeen by its own light when we do enjoy it. Secondly, If it be a true ſight or view that you have, you do abuſe that light. Firſt, by applying the rule of <hi>God &amp; Chriſt</hi> to man, by meaſuring the <hi>creature</hi> with the law of the <hi>Creator,</hi> or requiring that of poor <hi>man,</hi> which is the proper work of <hi>Chriſt himſelf.</hi> Secondly, You by this light or knowledge, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nothing of the thing it ſelf, which is Love, Peace, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but your own paſſion, Wrath and Contention. Thirdly, You, as the Phariſees, ſit in <hi>Moſes chair,</hi> get into the higheſt ſeat and places of Scripture, of everlaſting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and by that light, <hi>binde heavy burthens upon others, but touch them not with one of your fingers;</hi> live not the leaſt branch of that righteous and glorious Kingdom in your ſouls, families, or any of your converſations. Fourthly, if you had <hi>Power,</hi> and ſo opportunity, to ſhew how little you have of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this <hi>righteous Kingdom,</hi> you would be the moſt pitiful creatures that I know in the earth; the moſt deceiv'd, and ſo the moſt unhappy, becauſe deceiv'd in the greateſt thing, and in that which is your and our happineſs.</p>
            <p>You are now ending your witneſs; We ſuppoſe you have ſpoken all the ill that you knew, and all that you could rake up againſt them; and <hi>he</hi> that will ſpeak all the ill he can, will ſpeak more than is true. Now you have done <hi>witneſsing,</hi> you proceed to <hi>judge:</hi> You ſay, <hi>We ſuſpect and judge them to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115669:54"/>great tranſgreſſers therein:</hi> At laſt, all mounts but to <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> no evidence or demonſtration; and you <hi>ſuſpect, witneſs,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> your ſelves; you might leave the judgement to another; and <hi>ſuſpect</hi> and <hi>judge,</hi> 'tis a judgement upon ſuſpicion. I would not quibble upon words, if I did not think you did the tiling: That all this that you have writ, is but a <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> and a raſh <hi>judgement,</hi> drawn up in private, in your own dark and ſuſpicious thoughts, wherein you evidence nothing; and therefore, I do think, you might have left out <hi>Witneſs</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> in your Paper: And my Reaſons are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, A true ſpiritual <hi>witneſs convinces of ſin;</hi> now, I think, this will not <hi>convince</hi> them, becauſe, it doth not me, who am a ſtander by, and ready to receive a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt them. Your Paper renders them to me rather better than worſe, and your ſelves rather worſe than better: I did really think your Spirits had been more pure and ſimple in oppoſing them, than now they do appear.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, A true <hi>witneſs convinces of righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as of <hi>ſin:</hi> I finde nothing here, either of their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Chriſts righteouſneſs, brought forth, to blot out or forgive their ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">III Thirdly, The <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> ſpoken of in Scripture, which you think are your patern, are <hi>Olive-trees,</hi> and <hi>empty the golden oyl out of themſelves;</hi> they pour forth light and healing love; now, I finde not any drop of this <hi>oyl</hi> here, either to enlighten them to come to God out of their ſins, nor love or grate to heal or ſtrengthen them, but a bare dry accuſation of ſin, and threatning of judgement.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, Thoſe Witneſſes <hi>ſtand before the Lord of the whole earth,</hi> and declare what they ſee in him; which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable truth: but you teſtifie what you hear abroad, and what is in the mouthes of the moſt profane people; therefore, I confeſs, I would have you have higher thoughts of <hi>Saints-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsing,</hi> than to name ſuch a Paper by it.</p>
            <p>After ſome other particulars, which I will not meddle with, you do <hi>Diſclaim all adherence to, Owning of, or Joyning with theſe Men in theſe ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may ſeparate from them in ſome particular ways, but, I think, you are <hi>really one</hi> with them in their hearts and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115669:54"/>There is the ſame Good in them that is in you, and the ſame Evil in you that is in them: <hi>One</hi> in Nature and Grace, one in Cauſe and Quarrel, one in Religion, Liberty and Safety; and therefore <hi>diſclaim,</hi> and <hi>utterly diſclaim:</hi> but, brawling makes not a ſeparation 'twixt brethren, nor every ſcolding a divorce 'twixt husband and wife; me thinks your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in your <hi>Diſclaiming</hi> of them. For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, If you were not one with them, you would not be ſo much concern'd in their miſcarriage, not ſo much <hi>aſham'd</hi> and <hi>grieved,</hi> as you expreſs, for their evils; 'tis your feeling either the ſame or the like evils in your ſelves, that doth wound and prick your hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, You likewiſe finde and feel the ſame Good in them that is in your ſelves, under their ſins and ſufferings which troubles you; if you did not, you would retire private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuffer them to ſink and periſh in their own ways.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, There is much jealouſie in your mindes; this jealouſie ariſes from a ſecret union. You are within, ſenſible of ſome very good thing in the <hi>Protector,</hi> to which you have a right; and being jealous that his heart is not with you, nor for your way, you are inraged againſt him: yea, were you not ſenſible of a good ſpirit in him, and that much allied to you, I am perſwaded, you neither would nor durſt be ſo bold with him, as you are in your Paper. For if you thought him of a right Royal ſtamp, one that conſulted onely how to maintain his Greatneſs by force and policy, or, that his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were but as hard to you as ſome Presbyterians, you would not thus provoke him; but would rather ſtudy how to deſerve and preſerve your preſent Liberties, by a quiet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber uſe of them, than to adventure the loſs of them, by offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. You know the Sword is in a Brothers hands, which are tyed up by love and conſcience, and that makes you ſo bold with him and his Power.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, You here ſeem to diſown and diſclaim them; Alas, if your ſpirit were another from them, you might retire without noiſe: But you are by Intereſt, and by the frame of your Spirits engaged to the ſame kinde of publick Work; and therefore you may, as men that are angry, talk much more than you intend, and in a heat tumble out your
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115669:55"/>paſſions, which differ much from your diſpoſitions; for, I think, you neither can nor will leave them, nor the Work: for this conteſt, is not at all a diviſion of Enemies, but an offence of Brethren; not in the main ſubſtance of your buſineſs, but in ſome remote things; which, either more ſight and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or elſe the neceſſity of intereſt and ſafety, will overcome.</p>
            <p>Before you go, you would have ſome good company with you, and therefore, you deſire <hi>all the Lords people to withdraw from them.</hi> If you have not a very good company to follow you, you will, I hope, be ſo good natur'd as to abide with them, or ſtay for them, till they come to your light; for you are not ſo melancholick as cholerick, nor have you ſo good a Cauſe &amp; Conſcience (in your preſent conteſts) as to live alone with it.</p>
            <p>But tell us whither you would have us to withdraw; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into our own ſouls, to minde a more inward and ſpiritual work, or into our families, callings and congregations, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the worſhip of God in a private way, and to leave <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and outward National work, to them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it. But, I fear, you rather invite us into <hi>Wales</hi> to joyn with you there, or to raiſe a <hi>party</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> to begin <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other War:</hi> and if this be your minde, I ſhall onely in telling you, why the <hi>Lords people</hi> cannot joyn with you, take my leave of you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, We were urg'd and prick'd on to the former <hi>War</hi> by a <hi>neceſsity</hi> of <hi>a being;</hi> for the ſpirit of the King and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were ſuch, that we could not live (with a Liberty of our Conſciences) under their <hi>Government:</hi> Now having obtain'd this, though it be with great expence of Blood and Treaſure, yea, of many of our outward Rights and Liberties, yet we had rather ſit down quietly in this Freedom, with ſafety, than hazard this and all we have left us, by a <hi>New War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, <hi>War</hi> is a violent and deſperate medicine, to be applied onely in caſe of neceſſity upon incurable Enemies, whoſe ſpirits are ſet at ſuch a diſtance from, and enmity to the light of <hi>Godlineſs it ſelf,</hi> that they are beyond the reach of conviction; ſuch beaſts are fit for the ſword, who never felt nor knew any power but outward force; But for <hi>brethren</hi> that have been and are <hi>enlightned,</hi> and become ſubject to the leadings of conſcience, though they be fallen into a temptation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115669:55"/>and ſnare: the remedy for ſuch is not carnal but ſpiritual, and that is Light to be adminiſtred with patience and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſcience, and that too, ſo long as there is any ſpark of life, or any ſence at all of the fear of the Lord left in them; being by it, capable of reproof and inſtruction, they ſhould be attended upon with ſuteable means, in love and mercy. If all means of this kinde ſhould prove ineffectual, and that they ſhould go on to <hi>ſin wilfully, after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truth,</hi> yet an outward Sword would be improper, they being prepar'd and reſerv'd for a greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; <hi>a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation,</hi> Heb. 10.26, 27.</p>
            <p>But I believe, you cannot think that our <hi>Governors</hi> are gone ſo far back into obſtinate and wilful Wickedneſs; for thoſe things about which you differ, are diſputable things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> propounded and proſecuted with much carnal zeal, and offenſive weakneſs: And therefore it cannot be interpreted <hi>Wilful</hi> Ignorance, not to be convinc'd, but Weakneſs: And alas, do not we ſee they are in a continual hurry, toſſed with dangers, ſtriving all they can for life, which occaſions paſsions that darken the minde? Their ſpirits muſt needs be diſturbed and diſtempered with a multitude of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexing Cares, and therefore 'tis no wonder they <hi>take in</hi> or <hi>give forth</hi> no more light, or that their ſpirits and way is dark and miſty: From a State ſo ſick as ours is, ſo dangerouſly ſhaken, cannot be expected any acts of cleer Judgment, nor any progreſs in the work of Reformation. And now, while their Enemies are plotting Miſchief, and watching for Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and all they can do is little enough to preſerve our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for us, in this ſeaſon, to impoſe our own Opinions upon them, and to withdraw from them, and threaten them with Diviſion and War for not following them, is very unſeaſonable and unbrotherly, and weakens their hands that ſhould be ſtrengthned for our Defence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We do ſee, that in all reaſon a <hi>New War</hi> amongſt our ſelves, would open a way for the common Enemy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both parties; 'tis well if all united can ſubſiſt againſt them: But our Diviſions are their great hope, and the life of their Cauſe, the onely thing that ſupports their ſpirits, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115669:56"/>hardens them in oppoſition. You complain in your Paper, That they are <hi>offended,</hi> and that <hi>ſtumbling-blocks</hi> are laid in their way: But its evident, That nothing keeps them at ſuch a diſtance from us and conviction, as our differences amongſt our ſelves, which gives them hopes of recovering all; and thoſe hopes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold pride and enmity. Therefore, to <hi>war</hi> upon our Brethren, were to take their work out of their hands, and to betray that remnant that is left us, to the ſword firſt, &amp; then to their malice.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We are indeed weary of <hi>War,</hi> and do finde that it is at beſt but a ſad carnal thing: For, though this <hi>War</hi> was undertaken with ſome Honeſty and Simplicity, againſt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and Oppreſsing Enemy, yet we ſee no cauſe of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or boaſting of it; for we finde, the <hi>Sword</hi> is a devouring thing, it waſtes Treaſure, impoveriſhes a Nation, and loads it with Taxes: We complain of <hi>Taxes,</hi> 'tis not the fault of <hi>Governors,</hi> but the nature of the <hi>Sword</hi> is ſuch, it hath a <hi>great Mouth,</hi> and muſt be fed or worſe, and to begin <hi>New War,</hi> would multiply Taxes, as we multiply Armies and Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>War</hi> devours our Priviledges, Rights and Freedoms; 'tis Iron that <hi>breaks all into pieces,</hi> 'tis rough and hard, and will tear down Councils, Laws, Governments, Property and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: 'Tis not the men that uſe it, but the nature of the <hi>Sword</hi> and its miniſtry, is to tread down all things before it; and thoſe that are exercis'd in it, muſt either obey its commands, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its rules, or elſe the Sword it ſelf will go from them, or be taken from them, and be imploy'd againſt them: This the Sword hath done amongſt us; and they that draw it again, will certainly waſte what is left us of Right and Property, and leave us quite deſtitute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>War</hi> waſtes the peace and quiet of mens mindes, and fills them with Fury: For, <hi>Every battel of the Warrior is with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood,</hi> Iſa. 9.5. Blood ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtains the nature of man, makes him bruitiſh, uncivil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubject to Law and Authority, and fills the mindes of men with ſounds, and voices of Confuſion and Diviſion, of Fire and of Wrath; which makes men tumultuous, proud, cruel and imperious: Men, after a <hi>War,</hi> are an unquiet Sea, apt to be moved upon every diſcontent to War again: And this <hi>Blood rouls</hi> and tumbles in your Fancies, that you know not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115669:56"/>how to ſettle to a quiet life, but long to be in action again.</p>
            <p>Although there was a Righteouſneſs and Juſtice in our late <hi>War</hi> againſt our Enemies, yet it was not ſo pure a work, but if we look back upon it, we may ſee cauſe of Repentance; both from the nature of the work, and from the ſubject upon whom it was adminiſtred. <hi>War,</hi> when it is a Diſpenſation from God, yet it is a very low one, 'tis <hi>Senſual, Earthly</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh;</hi> if not in it ſelf, yet the corruptions of man mingling it ſelf with it, make it ſo; which, though it condemn not the Sword abſolutely, yet it may make the miniſtry unpleaſing to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Goſpel-ſpirit: The ſubject upon which 'twas admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, was mixt; there was a Legal Right the King and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had: There was in ſome a Legal humane Honeſty and Innocency, with much Ingenuity, natural Piety and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which when we conſider, we cannot be without ſome relenting towards them, and repenting of that Violence and Wrath wherewith we proſecuted them. So that we are more ready to repent of War againſt Enemies, than to begin one upon Friends: Our ſpirits, our light we hope riſes higher, into Meekneſs, Love and Moderation; ſo that though we condemn not former works, yet there may be a more excellent way: And, if it were to do again, conſidering all things, we ſhould be cooler than we were, and not ſo haſty to <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it would become us all, to waſh our ſouls in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Repentance, to wipe away the ſpots and defilements of <hi>War,</hi> and the guilt of Blood, of Violence and Wrath. It would be an excellent thing in our <hi>Governors,</hi> to begin and Order a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Humiliation</hi> for the Evils of the late War; To offer up publick <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> and to beg pardon of the Lord, and peace in our ſpirits and conſciences, that he that creates <hi>Peace,</hi> would be pleaſed to give it to us, firſt within, and then without: This, I think, would be the onely founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace, the onely way to ſoften our mindes to others, and others to us, and to cleanſe us from inward rancor, and from guilt, which makes men wrathful, contentious &amp; unquiet.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, While the Sword is neceſſary for our Defence, as we yet conceive it is, we think it in the beſt hands, and beſt ſetled where it is; Becauſe it is by Providence diſpos'd to them in the ordinary courſe of <hi>War,</hi> the generality of them having
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115669:57"/>carryed on the work from the begining, therefore they have a Right to their Power and Command: And we judge it wiſely diſpoſed by Providence into ſuch hands, who are large in their ſpirits, to comprehend and to take into Imployment and Love, all ſorts of <hi>Honeſt men:</hi> Whereby, the Sword is more eaſie, the work more ſecure, and greater hopes of Peace. Whereas if we ſhould joyn with you, to get the Sword into your hands, the <hi>Sword</hi> will be the <hi>Sword</hi> ſtill, and in mens hands of nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower ſpirits, which would make it more dangerous and more cruel: So that we muſt deal plainly with you, if we attempt a <hi>New War,</hi> we ſhall but fight away that little of <hi>Money,</hi> that little of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> that little of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> that is left; and fight our ſelves into new <hi>Troubles,</hi> new <hi>Sins</hi> and new <hi>Defilements</hi> of our <hi>Brethrens Bloods,</hi> which will be Blood of a deep dye; and at laſt have no fruit but this, To be in worſe hands than we are: who, though they ſeem to have more Light, yet we are ſure have leſs Love, and ſo moſt unfit to Command the Sword.</p>
            <p>You have therefore no hope to draw us into your Deſign, if it be <hi>war;</hi> let us then perſwade you to withdraw from it, and from thoſe that would ſeduce you into it: 'Tis my earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to you, that you would wait at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in a holy and humble ſerving of the Lord, till you have <hi>power from on high,</hi> and then if our Governors do not prevent you, by bringing forth ſome better fruit, you wil be able with wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to convince and reſtore them, or to carry on the work of the Lord upon your ſelves and others, in ſpirit and judgment: And leave theſe men to the Lord, who wil either lead them out of theſe preſent miſts, if they humbly and ſincerely attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or if they be unfaithful to him, he to whom they have appeal'd, and whoſe ſervants they are, will judge righteous Judgment upon them.</p>
